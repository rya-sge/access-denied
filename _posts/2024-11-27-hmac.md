HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code) is a cryptographic algorithm used to ensure both **integrity** and **authenticity** of a message. 

It combines a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) with a secret key, creating a tamper-proof mechanism for verifying that data has not been altered or forged.

## Introduction

Unlike encryption, which protects the confidentiality of data, HMAC ensures the data's authenticity and integrity, making it a critical component of secure communication protocols.

- Published in 1996 by Bellare, Canetti and Krawczyk
- Standardized in [RFC 2104](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2104), and in the document [NIST FIPS PUB 198](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.198-1.pdf)
- Constructs a MAC from any hash function cryptographically secure 
- HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA1 are very widely used in practice (TLS, IPSec, etc.)
-  Transition to HMAC-SHA2.

### Terms

The following key terms are relevant to understand HMAC

From [nist.fips.198-1.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.198-1.pdf)

- Cryptographic key (key): a parameter used in conjunction with a cryptographic algorithm that determines the specific operation of that algorithm. In this Standard, the cryptographic key is used by the HMAC algorithm to produce a MAC on the data. 

- Hash function: a mathematical function that maps a string of arbitrary length (up to a predetermined maximum size) to a fixed length string. 
- Keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC): a message authentication code that uses a cryptographic key in conjunction with a hash function. 
- Message Authentication Code (MAC): a cryptographic checksum that results from passing data through a message authentication algorithm. In this Standard, the message authentication algorithm is called HMAC, while the result of applying HMAC is called the MAC. 
- Secret key: a cryptographic key that is uniquely associated with one or more entitie. The term "secret" implies the need to protect the key from disclosure or substitution. 



### Basic MAC Workflow

- Alice and Bob agree on a shared secret K.
- Alice sends her message X as well as the MAC value
  `t`to Bob.

$$
τ = MAC_K (X)
$$



- Bob calculates `t` with the message X' received.

$$
τ = MAC_K (X' )
$$



- The message is accepted if and only if
  $$
  T = T'
  $$
   where `T'`is the value of the MAC attached to the message.

#### Security

We say that a MAC is cryptographically secure if it is impossible in practice to forge a valid pair 
$$
x', MAC_K(x')
$$
with
$$
x_i \neq x'
$$
 from one or more pairs 
$$
x_i, MAC_K(x_i)
$$
The message `x'` does not need to make sense!

## How HMAC Works

$$
MAC(text) = HMAC(K, text) = H((K_0 ⊕ opad )|| H((K_0 ⊕ ipad) || text))
$$

HMAC uses a hash function and a secret key to compute a MAC (Message Authentication Code). 

Before describing the process, here two constants defined by the algorithm;

`o_pad = 0x5C5C5C . . . 5C`
`i_pad = 0x363636 . . . 36`

### Schema

### Workflow

The process involves the following steps:

1. **Preparation of Keys**:

   - If the key is longer than the block size of the hash function (e.g., 64 bytes for SHA-256), it is hashed to produce a shorter key.
   - If the key is shorter than the block size, it is padded with zeros to match the block size.

2. **Key Mixing**:

   - Two derived keys are created: an **inner padded key** `ipad` and an **outer padded key** `opad`).
   - 

   $$
   \text{ikey\_pad} = \text{key} \oplus o\_{pad}
   $$

   

   - 

   $$
   \text{okey\_pad} = \text{key} \oplus i\_{pad}
   $$

   

3. **Hashing Process**:

   - Compute an intermediate hash using the inner padded key and the message: 

   $$
   H_{inner}=H(ikey\_pad ∣∣ message)
   $$

   

   - Compute the final HMAC by hashing the outer padded key concatenated with the intermediate hash: 

$$
MAC =H(okey\_pad ∣∣ H_{inner})
$$

Here, H represents the hash function (e.g., SHA-256), ∣∣||∣∣ denotes concatenation, and ⊕\oplus⊕ denotes the XOR operation.

## Use Cases of HMAC

HMAC is widely used in security scenarios:

1. **Data Integrity and Authentication**:
   - Ensures that data has not been tampered with during transmission and that it originates from a trusted source.
2. **Secure Protocols**:
   - HMAC is a core component of protocols like TLS (for HTTPS), IPsec, and SSH to ensure secure communication.
3. **API Authentication**:
   - Used in systems like AWS, where API requests include HMAC-based signatures to authenticate clients.
4. **Password Storage and Key Derivation**:
   - Forms a crucial part of algorithms like PBKDF2 for securely storing passwords.

------

## Security of HMAC

HMAC provides robust security due to the following reasons:

1. **Resistance to Cryptographic Attacks**:

   HMAC is secure as long as the underlying hash function (e.g., SHA-256) is cryptographically strong.

2. **Key-Based Authentication**:

   The secret key ensures that only someone with access to the key can generate valid HMACs, protecting against forgery.

3. **Prevention of Length Extension Attacks**:

   By incorporating a key into the hash computation, HMAC is resistant to length extension attacks that exploit properties of some hash functions.

4. **Collision Resistance**:

   - Birthday attack

   HMAC is considered as secure against birthday attacks wich are totally impractical.

   As indicated in the [RFC-2104](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2104), the strongest attack known against HMAC is based on the frequency of collisions for the hash function H ("birthday attack"). For example, a birthday attack with md5:

    "if we consider a hash function like MD5 where the output length equals L=16 bytes (128 bits) the attacker needs to acquire the correct message authentication tags computed (with th _same_ secret key K!) on about 2**64 known plaintexts".
   
   - Hash function vulnerable to collision attack
   
   >  Not totally sure about this paragraph
   
   I have seen different point of view against collision attack on the underlying hash function
   
   The RFC [RFC-2104](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2104) states that the hash function must be replaced if the hash function contains serious flaws in the collision behaviour (e.g.  collisions found after 2**30 messages)
   
   But on [StackExchange](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/187866/why-aren-t-collisions-important-with-hmac), a user indicated that even if the hash function is vulnerable to collision, the attack must also perform a successful key recovery attack.

### HMAC with PBKDF2

PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is a key derivation function that generates cryptographically strong keys from an input, generally a password. It uses HMAC as a *pseudo-random function* (*PRF*) to provide resistance against brute-force and dictionary attacks.

Simple hashes function like SHA-256 are vulnerable to **dictionary attacks**

To derive the key or the password, you will use a salt stored in a secure place to derive the same key again from the same input.

See [cryptobook.nakov.com - hmac-and-key-derivation](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/mac-and-key-derivation/hmac-and-key-derivation) and [RFC 2898 (PKCS #5)](http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt)

### Why Use HMAC in PBKDF2?

- **Cryptographic Strength**: HMAC ensures the derived keys are resistant to cryptographic attacks, leveraging the strength of hash functions.
- **Slows Down Attackers**: The iterative nature of PBKDF2, combined with HMAC, increases the computational effort required for brute-force attacks.
- **Salt Protection**: The salt prevents the use of precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables).

------

### Conclusion

HMAC offers a secure method to verify the integrity and authenticity of data. 

It can also be as a  *pseudo-random function* (*PRF*) by a Key Derivation Algorithm such as PBKDF2 to derive a cryptographic key.
