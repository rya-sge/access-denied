This article is a summary of the main concepts behind the [5. EIP-4844:Proto-Danksharding,](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844)

The main reference of this article is a lesson from LearnWeb3: [1.Proto-Danksharding: Scaling Ethereum using Blobs](https://learnweb3.io/lessons/proto-danksharding-scaling-ethereum-using-blobs/)

## Introduction

With the next Ethereum Upgrade, Duncan, a new transaction format will be introduced: **EIP-4844 Shared blob transactions.**

Currently, rollup uses calldata to post their transaction on the Layer 1 Ethereum. This is expensive because it is processed by all Ethereum nodes and lives on chain forever.

But rollups only need the data for a short time. For example, optimism rollup only needs the data available during the challenge period, e.g. one week on Arbitrum One.

Proto-Danksharding introduces data blobs that can be sent and attached to blocks. The data in these blobs is not accessible to the EVM and is automatically deleted after a fixed time period (18 days in the EIP).  

Since the data are not stored forever, it makes the whole process cheaper for rollup, thanks to their own price mechanism.



## Common Concept

### Rollup

A rollup is a blockchain that runs on top of Ethereum, reason why they are called *Layer 2 Blockchains.* The goal is that users conduct most of their transactions on the rollup chains instead of the Layer 1 Mainnet. 

There are two main types of rullup: Optimistic Rollups & ZK Rollup

#### Limitation

Right now, rollups post their transactions in `CALLDATA`.

This is expensive because it is processed by all Ethereum nodes and lives on chain forever, even though rollups only need the data for a short time

Reference: [6. ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/).

#### Sequencers

A group of nodes called *sequencers* are in charge of batching (or *rolling up*) many Layer 2 transactions into a single Layer 1 transaction [[2. domothy.com/blobspace/](https://domothy.com/blobspace/)].

### Sharding

#### Sharding

The Ethereum blockchain is divided into mini shards - distinct pieces of the blockchain - which can all run in parallel.

#### Validator assignation

The Beacon Chain can then randomly assign validators on the network to different shards and periodically shuffle them up. 

#### Attack of 51%

An attacker wishes to perform a 51% attack on a specific shard would still have to  control 51% of the entire validator set, otherwise their chances of  having their validators randomly assigned to the same shard are near  zero. [[2. domothy.com/blobspace/](https://domothy.com/blobspace/)]

## Danksharding

###  Introduction

#### Goal

Focus on helping rollups scale

#### Principle

The concept of sharding is replaced by *blobs*. These blobs are constructed in a clever way so that although blocks are filled with big blobs, each individual node only needs to do a very small amount of work to check that all the data is  available (DA) [[2. domothy.com/blobspace/](https://domothy.com/blobspace/)].

##### Data Availability (DA)

 A way to ensure that all data needed for the network to continue in a valid manner is available without needing to download and verify all of it by hand

#### Trade-off

The construction of a block becomes a very heavy process in terms of bandwidth  and computation, which is a centralizing force on block builders.

This kind of task can be, however, done by centralized block builders using  high performance machines, already done due to MEV [[2. domothy.com/blobspace/](https://domothy.com/blobspace/)].

## Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844)

This part is described in the EIP [4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844).

Proto-Danksharding introduces data blobs that can be sent and attached to blocks. The data in these blobs is not accessible to the EVM and is automatically deleted after a fixed time period (18 days according to the EIP), making the whole process cheaper for rollup.

Reference: [6. ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/).

### Blob-carrying transactions

In addition to the traditional parameters `sender`, `receiver`, `nonce`, `gas` , this new type of transaction contains two new things:

1. `max_fee_per_blob_gas`: a bid by the sequencer on how much they're willing to pay for the blob
2. `blob_version_hashes`: a list of hashes of blobs - since each transaction can include multiple blobs

The transaction doesn't contain the blob data itself. It only contains a list of hashes of the blobs. 

#### Blob construction

The actual blob data itself, under the hood, is constructed using some special mathematical schemes, called *KZG commitment* which allow optimizations on the network allowing us to heavily speed up computations.

The additional calldata will be committed to using a KZG commitment.

- **KZG Commitment** is a polynomial commitment scheme adopted by EIP-4844 proto-danksharding

- **KZG Ceremony** is the process of trust setup for KZG Commitment

#### Blob data max size

The blob can contain upto roughly ~125 KB (kilobytes) of data - which is roughly 128,000 bytes

### Blob pricing market

The blob transactions have their own gas pricing mechanic, named **blob gas**. It is similar to the pricing mechanic for [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) transactions that exist on Ethereum today. 

- Target of 3 blobs per block on the network, with a hard upper limit of 6 blobs per block. 
- Running alongside the existing gas mechanic (EIP-1559)

The separation of the pricing mechanics between EIP-1559 transactions and blob transactions (blob gas is priced independently) prevents one from affecting the other in case of peak.

## Use case

This paragraph comes mainly from the [eip-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844) specification.

### Optimistic rollups

With Optimism rollup, the underlying data  are only submitted in case of a challenge with the fraud proofs.

The fraud proof system can verify the transition in smaller steps, loading at  most a few values of the blob at a time through calldata. 

For each value:

- It would provide a KZG proof and use the point evaluation precompile to verify the value against the versioned hash that was submitted before, 
- Then perform the fraud proof verification on that data as is done today.

### ZK rollup

ZK rollups would provide two commitments to their transaction or state delta data: 

- The blob commitment, which the protocol ensures points to available  data.
- ZK rollupâ€™s own commitment using whatever proof system the rollup uses internally. 

They would use a proof of equivalence protocol, using the point evaluation precompile, to prove that the two commitments refer to the same data.
