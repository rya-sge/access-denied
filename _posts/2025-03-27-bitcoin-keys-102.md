This article explains how wallets generate seed phrases and derive private keys using standard Bitcoin Propsals (BIP). 

- [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki):  Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets
- [BIP-39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki): Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys
- [BIP-44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki):  Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets

## General workflow

As a reminder, the general workflow is the following

1.Generate the seed phrase

2.Create a private key

3.Compute the public key

4.Derive the Bitcoin address from the public key

You can find more details in my article: [Bitcoin Keys 101 - From seed phrase to address](https://rya-sge.github.io/access-denied/2024/10/28/bitcoin-keys-101/)

## BIP-39: Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys

> Author: Marek Palatinus, Pavol Rusnak, Aaron Voisine, Sean Bowe
> [bip-0039.mediawiki](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)

This BIP describes the implementation of a mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence -- a group of easy to remember words -- for the generation of deterministic wallets.

It consists of two parts:

-  generating the seed phrase
- converting it into a binary seed. 

This seed can be later used to generate deterministic wallets using BIP-0032 or similar methods.

### Why 24 words instead of 12 ?

24 words, instead of 12, is also used in practice. But is it really useful ?

Their goal of this greater entropy is to make more difficult to compute the whole seed phase if you know part of the seed phrase

If an attacker knowns:

-  half of a 128-bit code (64 bits), it’s plausible that they’ll be able to brute force the remaining 64 bits.

- half of a 256-bit code (128 bits), it’s not plausible that they can brute force the other half.

The 24-words was also used by Trezor against a keylogger. Since you have to use the interface, a keylooger could know all the seed words but not the order. In that case 24 words is much safer. At least  that's true for the Trezor.

## BIP-32: Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets

See [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)

BIP32 defines Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets. This BIP introduces two main concepts

BIP32 introduces two important concepts: key derivation and the hierarchical tree structure.

- **Key Derivation**:  Keys and addresses  are derivedd from a single root key known as the master private key. 
  - Child keys are derived from this root in a deterministic way
  - Public keys are generated without revealing the corresponding private keys, which ensures privacy.

- **Hierarchical Tree Structure**: Keys can be organized in a multi-level tree structure. A wallet can have and use different child keys, grandchild keys, etc.

### Summary

| Standard | Script          | BIP32 path    |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| BIP44    | P2PKH           | `m/44'/0'/0'` |
| BIP49    | Nested P2WPKH   | `m/49'/1'/0'` |
| BIP84    | P2WPKH          | `m/84'/0'/0'` |
| BIP86    | P2TR Single-key | `m/86'/0'/0'` |

## BIP-44: Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets

See [Bip 0044](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki)

This BIP defines a logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets based on an algorithm described in BIP-0032 (BIP32 from now on) and purpose scheme described in BIP-0043.

This BIP defines the following 5 levels in BIP32 path:

```
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
```

Each level has a specific meaning:

| Level           | Example | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `m`             |         | Master node (root of the HD tree)                            |
| `purpose'`      | `44'`   | Always `44` for BIP-44-compliant wallets                     |
| `coin_type'`    | `0'`    | Coin type (e.g., `0` = Bitcoin, `2` = Litecoin) — defined in [SLIP-44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) |
| `account'`      | `0'`    | Account index — supports multiple user accounts              |
| `change`        | `0`     | `0` = external (receiving), `1` = internal (change)          |
| `address_index` | `0`     | Address number in the chain                                  |

Note:

The value of `coin_type`is registed in [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) maintained by SatoshiLabs

| Blockchain | Value |
| ---------- | ----- |
| bitcoin    | 0     |
| Dogecoin   | 3     |
| Ethereum   | 60    |
| Solana     | 501   |
