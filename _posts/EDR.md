As mentioned, Wazuh is an EDR; let's briefly run through what an EDR is. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) are tools and applications that monitor devices for an activity that could indicate a threat or security breach. These tools and applications have features that include:

- Auditing a device for common vulnerabilities
- Proactively monitoring a device for suspicious activity such as unauthorized logins, brute-force attacks, or privilege escalations.
- Visualizing complex data and events into neat and trendy graphs
- Recording a device's normal operating behaviour to help with detecting anomalies
