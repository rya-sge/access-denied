# ERC-4337: Account Abstraction Using Alt Mempool 



An account abstraction proposal which completely avoids consensus-layer protocol changes, instead relying on higher-layer infrastructure.





##  Main concepts

### EIP Required

#### EIP-712: typed structured data hashing and signing

[EIP specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712)

A procedure for hashing and signing of typed structured data as opposed to just bytestrings.

#### EIP-7562: Account Abstraction Validation Scope Rules

[EIP-7562 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7562)

A set of limitations on validation EVM code to protect Account Abstraction nodes from denial-of-service attacks through unpaid computation.

This EIP describes the rules Account Abstraction protocols should follow, during the validation phase of Account Abstraction transactions, such as [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) `UserOperation` or RIP-7560 (Native Account Abstraction), which are enforced off-chain by a block builder or a standalone bundler, and the rationale behind each one of them.



### Definitions

| **Term**                              | Type                  | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **UserOperation**                     | struct                | A structure similar to a transaction, but with additional fields. Contains sender’s signature and more. |
| **Sender**                            | Smart Contract        | The Smart Contract Account sending the UserOperation.        |
| **EntryPoint**                        | Smart Contract        | A contract that executes bundles of UserOperations. Bundlers must whitelist supported EntryPoints. |
| **Bundler**                           | node                  | A node that handles UserOperations, creates valid transactions, and adds them to blocks. Can work with block-building infrastructure. |
| **Paymaster**                         | Smart Contract        | A contract that agrees to pay for the transaction costs, instead of the sender. |

| **Canonical UserOperation Mempool**   | Decentralized network | A decentralized network where valid UserOperations conforming to ERC-7562 are exchanged. |
| **Alternative UserOperation Mempool** | Decentralized network | A P2P network with its own rules for validating UserOperations, different from ERC-7562. |
| **Deposit**                           | Currency              | Ether (or L2 native currency) transferred by Sender or Paymaster to EntryPoint to cover future gas costs. |



#### UserOperation

To avoid Ethereum consensus changes, we do not attempt to create new transaction types for account-abstracted transactions. Instead, users package up the action they want their Smart Contract Account to take in a struct named `UserOperation`:

| Field                           | Type      | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sender`                        | `address` | The Account making the `UserOperation`                       |
| `nonce`                         | `uint256` | Anti-replay parameter (see “Semi-abstracted Nonce Support” ) |
| `factory`                       | `address` | Account Factory for new Accounts OR `0x7702` flag for EIP-7702 Accounts, otherwise `address(0)` |
| `factoryData`                   | `bytes`   | data for the Account Factory if `factory` is provided OR EIP-7702 initialization data, or empty array |
| `callData`                      | `bytes`   | The data to pass to the `sender` during the main execution call |
| `callGasLimit`                  | `uint256` | The amount of gas to allocate the main execution call        |
| `verificationGasLimit`          | `uint256` | The amount of gas to allocate for the verification step      |
| `preVerificationGas`            | `uint256` | Extra gas to pay the bundler                                 |
| `maxFeePerGas`                  | `uint256` | Maximum fee per gas (similar to [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) `max_fee_per_gas`) |
| `maxPriorityFeePerGas`          | `uint256` | Maximum priority fee per gas (similar to EIP-1559 `max_priority_fee_per_gas`) |
| `paymaster`                     | `address` | Address of paymaster contract, (or empty, if the `sender` pays for gas by itself) |
| `paymasterVerificationGasLimit` | `uint256` | The amount of gas to allocate for the paymaster validation code (only if paymaster exists) |
| `paymasterPostOpGasLimit`       | `uint256` | The amount of gas to allocate for the paymaster post-operation code (only if paymaster exists) |
| `paymasterData`                 | `bytes`   | Data for paymaster (only if paymaster exists)                |
| `signature`                     | `bytes`   | Data passed into the `sender` to verify authorization        |

#### Entry-point

The core interface of the `EntryPoint` contract is as follows:

```solidity
function handleOps(PackedUserOperation[] calldata ops, address payable beneficiary);
```

The `beneficiary` is the address that will be paid with all the gas fees collected during the execution of the bundle.

#### Smart account

The core interface required for the Smart Contract Account to have is:

```solidity
interface IAccount {
  function validateUserOp
      (PackedUserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 userOpHash, uint256 missingAccountFunds)
      external returns (uint256 validationData);
}
```

The `userOpHash` is a hash over the `userOp` (except `signature`), `entryPoint` and `chainId`.

| **Requirement**                        | **MUST**                                                     | **SHOULD**                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Validate the caller**                | The Smart Contract Account must validate the caller is a trusted EntryPoint. |                                                              |
| **Validate the signature**             | The Smart Contract Account must validate that the signature is a valid signature of the userOpHash. |                                                              |
| **Handle signature mismatch**          |                                                              | The Smart Contract Account should return SIG_VALIDATION_FAILED (1) without reverting on signature mismatch. |
| **Handle error on signature mismatch** | Any other error must revert.                                 |                                                              |
| **Early return behavior**              |                                                              | The Smart Contract Account should not return early when returning SIG_VALIDATION_FAILED (1). Instead, it should complete the normal flow to enable performing a gas estimation for the validation function. |
| **Pay the EntryPoint**                 | The Smart Contract Account must pay the EntryPoint at least the missingAccountFunds. |                                                              |
| **Pay more than the minimum**          |                                                              | The sender may pay more than the minimum to cover future transactions and can call `withdrawTo` to retrieve it later. |
| **Return value**                       | The return value must be packed with the aggregator/authorizer, validUntil, and validAfter timestamps. |                                                              |
| **Aggregator/authorizer value**        | The aggregator/authorizer value must be 0 for valid signature, 1 for signature failure, or an address of an aggregator/authorizer contract (as per ERC-7766). |                                                              |
| **validUntil timestamp**               | The validUntil timestamp must be a 6-byte value, or zero for “infinite”. The UserOperation is valid only up to this time. |                                                              |
| **validAfter timestamp**               | The validAfter timestamp must be a 6-byte value. The UserOperation is valid only after this time. |                                                              |



##  Semi-abstracted Nonce Support

### Ethereum protocol

In Ethereum protocol, the sequential transaction `nonce` value has several purposes:

-  It is used as a replay protection method
- To determine the valid order of transaction being included in blocks.
- It also contributes to the transaction hash uniqueness, as a transaction by the same sender with the same nonce may not be included in the chain twice.

### ERC-4337

Requiring a single sequential `nonce` value is limiting to the senders’ ability to define their custom logic with regard to transaction ordering and replay protection.

Instead of sequential `nonce` , this ERC implement a nonce mechanism that uses a single `uint256` nonce value in the `UserOperation`, but treats it as two values:

- 192-bit “key”
- 64-bit “sequence”

These values are represented on-chain in the `EntryPoint` contract. We define the following method in the `EntryPoint` interface to expose these values:

```solidity
function getNonce(address sender, uint192 key) external view returns (uint256 nonce);
```

### Nonce verification

For each `key` the `sequence` is validated by the `EntryPoint` for each UserOperation. If the nonce validation fails the `UserOperation` is considered invalid and the bundle is reverted. The `sequence` value is incremented sequentially and monotonically for the `sender` for each UserOperation. 

A new `key` can be introduced with an arbitrary value at any point, with its `sequence` starting at `0`.

This approach maintains the guarantee of `UserOperation` hash uniqueness on-chain on the protocol level while allowing Accounts to implement any custom logic they may need operating on a 192-bit “key” field, while fitting the 32 byte word.

## Entry-point

### Required `EntryPoint` contract functionality

The `EntryPoint` method is `handleOps`, which handles an array of `UserOperations`

The `EntryPoint`’s `handleOps` function must perform the following steps (we first describe the simpler non-paymaster case). It must make two loops, the **verification loop** and the **execution loop**. In the verification loop, the `handleOps` call must perform the following steps for each `UserOperation`:

- Create the `sender` Smart Contract Account if it does not yet exist, using the `initcode` provided in the `UserOperation`.
  - If the `factory` address is “0x7702”, then the sender MUST be an EOA with an [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) authorization designation. The `EntryPoint` validates the authorized address matches the one specified in the `UserOperation` signature (see [Support for [EIP-7702\] authorizations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#support-for-eip-7702-authorizations)).
  - If the `sender` does not exist, *and* the `initcode` is empty, or does not deploy a contract at the “sender” address, the call must fail.
- calculate the maximum possible fee the `sender` needs to pay based on validation and call gas limits, and current gas values.
- calculate the fee the `sender` must add to its “deposit” in the `EntryPoint`
- **Call `validateUserOp` on the `sender` contract**, passing in the `UserOperation`, its hash and the required fee. The Smart Contract Account SHOULD verify the `UserOperation`’s signature, and pay the fee if the `sender` considers the `UserOperation` valid. If any `validateUserOp` call fails, `handleOps` must skip execution of at least that `UserOperation`, and may revert entirely.
- Validate the account’s deposit in the `EntryPoint` is high enough to cover the max possible cost (cover the already-done verification and max execution gas)

In the execution loop, the `handleOps` call must perform the following steps for each `UserOperation`:

- **Call the account with the `UserOperation`’s calldata**. It’s up to the account to choose how to parse the calldata; an expected workflow is for the account to have an `execute` function that parses the remaining calldata as a series of one or more calls that the account should make.
- If the calldata starts with the methodsig `IAccountExecute.executeUserOp`, then the `EntryPoint` must build a calldata by encoding `executeUserOp(userOp,userOpHash)` and call the account using that calldata.
- After the call, refund the account’s deposit with the excess gas cost that was pre-charged.
  A penalty of `10%` (`UNUSED_GAS_PENALTY_PERCENT`) is applied on the amounts of `callGasLimit` and `paymasterPostOpGasLimit` gas that remains **unused**.
  This penalty is only applied if the amount of the remaining unused gas is greater than or equal `40000` (`PENALTY_GAS_THRESHOLD`).
  This penalty is necessary to prevent the `UserOperations` from reserving large parts of the gas space in the bundle but leaving it unused and preventing the bundler from including other `UserOperations`.
- After the execution of all calls, pay the collected fees from all `UserOperations` to the `beneficiary` address provided by the bundler.

### Paymaster

The `EntryPoint` logic supports also**paymasters** that can sponsor transactions for other users. This feature can be used to allow application developers to subsidize fees for their users, allow users to pay fees with [ERC-20] tokens and many other use cases. 

When the `paymasterAndData` field in the `UserOperation` is not empty, the `EntryPoint` implements a different flow for that UserOperation:

```solidity
function validatePaymasterUserOp
    (PackedUserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 userOpHash, uint256 maxCost)
    external returns (bytes memory context, uint256 validationData);

function postOp
    (PostOpMode mode, bytes calldata context, uint256 actualGasCost, uint256 actualUserOpFeePerGas)
    external;

enum PostOpMode {
    opSucceeded, // UserOperation succeeded
    opReverted // UserOperation reverted. paymaster still has to pay for gas.
}
```
