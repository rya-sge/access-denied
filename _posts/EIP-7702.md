### New transaction type

EIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type: `setcode tx` with the following elements:

- Chaind id
- nonce
- maxFeePerGas
- maxPriorityFeePerGas
- gasLimit
- value
- data
- accessList
- authorizationlist
- signature

#### AuthorizationList

Inside this authorization list, you have alos 4 four new elements: `chain id`, `address``nonce`, signature`.

Inside this list, you have the authoriatuon: you will authorize some code ?

### Creation by template

- Instead of running initcode, write the target template code to the account
  - Initialize later via regular call
- Less calldata needed => 20 bytes for template address versus ~25-30 extra bytes for setup
- Minimize odds that users change delegation frequently
- Due to EIP-3607, transactions from an account w/ code are invalid
  - Need to work arount this
  - Solution: delegation designator
  - 0xef => it is not possible to deploy today a contract which begins by 0xef
  - 0100 => to say itiis 7702 delegator address
  - After that you have the target address
