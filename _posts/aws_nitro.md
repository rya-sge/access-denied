**Building Secure, Smart, and Scalable Blockchain Wallets with AWS Nitro Enclaves**.

### **Building Blocks of Blockchain Wallets**

Developing blockchain wallets demands a secure and scalable architecture. Key components include:

- **Key Management**: Using AWS Key Management Service (KMS), CloudHSM, or Secrets Manager for secure key handling.
- **Access Management**: Employing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and CloudTrail for auditing.
- **Compute Layer**: Efficient computation using AWS Lambda, EC2, or Nitro Enclaves.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implementing Amazon CloudWatch for operational insights.
- **Low Latency Access**: Leveraging AWS cluster placement groups for performance-critical use cases.

### AWS Lambda

Run code without thinking about servers or clusters

AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources, making it the fastest way to turn an idea into a modern, production, serverless applications.

### AWS Nitro Enclaves

Create additional isolation to further protect highly sensitive data within EC2 instances

AWS Nitro Enclaves enables customers to create isolated compute environments to further protect and securely process highly sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII), healthcare, financial, and intellectual property data within their Amazon EC2 instances. Nitro Enclaves uses the same Nitro Hypervisor technology that provides CPU and memory isolation for EC2 instances.

Nitro Enclaves helps customers reduce the attack surface area for their most sensitive data processing applications. Enclaves offers an isolated, hardened, and highly constrained environment to host security-critical applications. Nitro Enclaves includes cryptographic attestation for your software, so that you can be sure that only authorized code is running, as well as integration with the AWS Key Management Service, so that only your enclaves can access sensitive material.

There are no additional charges for using AWS Nitro Enclaves other than the use of Amazon EC2 instances and any other AWS services that are used with Nitro Enclaves.

### **Implementing Blockchain Wallets on AWS**

1. **Hot Wallets**
   Hot wallets can be implemented with AWS Lambda and KMS for serverless operation. Transactions are processed via API Gateway, with KMS providing signature services.
2. **Cold Wallets**
   Cold wallets utilize AWS CloudHSM within a private subnet, ensuring complete offline functionality. These wallets are highly secure and suited for institutional custody solutions.

### **Advanced Wallet Solutions by Circle**

Circle offers enterprise-grade programmable wallets built on its blockchain infrastructure. Their solutions cater to developers with varying expertise, from crypto-native to Web2 developers unfamiliar with blockchain intricacies. Key offerings include:

- **Developer-Controlled Wallets**: Provide full control over transactions and keys.
- **MPC Wallets**: Employ multi-party computation for secure, customizable user experiences.
- **Modular Wallets**: Allow extensibility with standards like ERC-6900 for tailored functionality.

Circle’s architecture integrates AWS KMS and MPC servers for robust key management and transaction reconciliation. Developers can also run their MPC nodes, offering flexibility and control.

### **Fireblocks and Nitro Enclaves for Institutional Blockchain Infrastructure**

**Maayan:**
At Fireblocks, we provide blockchain infrastructure and wallet services to institutional clients like Bank of New York Mellon and ANZ. Handling such high transaction volumes requires robust and secure systems, which is where Nitro Enclaves and confidential computing come into play.

#### **Transaction Flow and Security Focus**

1. **Transaction Initialization**: Transactions are created via a web UI or API and processed by the policy engine, which enforces user-defined rules.
2. **Serialization and Signing**: Protocol-specific serialization converts the transaction into the correct format before signing with private keys.

Critical stages like the policy engine, serialization, and signing are fortified with confidential computing.

#### **Multiparty Computation (MPC) and Key Security**

- MPC ensures no single point of failure by splitting keys into logical shards managed by multiple co-signers.
- Key shards are distributed among Fireblocks’ co-signers and a customer-hosted co-signer, eliminating the risk of key theft from a single location.

#### **Co-Signer Architecture**

1. **Setup**: Customers configure S3 buckets, Nitro-enabled EC2 instances, and AWS KMS keys.
2. **Encrypted Database**: Key shards stored in S3 are encrypted using KMS keys.
3. **Attestation and Decryption**: The enclave verifies its integrity via KMS attestation before decrypting the database.
4. **Signing Transactions**: The co-signer fetches transactions, participates in MPC communications, and signs securely.

### **AWS Nitro Enclaves for Blockchain Workloads**

AWS Nitro Enclaves enhance security and isolation for blockchain applications. These lightweight, constrained virtual machines operate independently within an EC2 instance, ensuring:

- **Data Protection**: No external networking or administrator access.
- **Isolation**: Enclaves are entirely separate from the parent instance.
- **Ephemeral Storage**: All data exists only in memory, ensuring transient security.

Nitro Enclaves support cryptographic attestation, allowing enclaves to verify their integrity and state. This feature integrates seamlessly with KMS policies, ensuring only trusted applications access sensitive keys.

### **Conclusion**

Blockchain wallets are the backbone of decentralized applications, and implementing them securely is critical. 

The goal of AWS services, particularly Nitro Enclaves, is to provide a framework for developing wallets that are secure, smart, and scalable. 

By combining AWS’s advanced computing solutions with insights from industry leaders like Circle and Fireblocks, developers can create cutting-edge wallet solutions that cater to diverse use cases and user needs.
