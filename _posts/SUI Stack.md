\- Seal is a decentralized secrets management (DSM) service that relies on access control policies defined and validated on Sui. This can be used to keep data secure, notably with Walrus to provide encryption and access control. For that, Seal uses the Boneh–Franklin scheme as Identity-Based Encryption (IBE).
