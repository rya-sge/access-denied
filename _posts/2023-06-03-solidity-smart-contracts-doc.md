This article presents some very interesting tools to perform an analyze of a smart contract written in *Solidity* and generate the documentation.

Here a summary:

- [Solidity-docgen](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen): extract the documentation
- [Surya](https://github.com/ConsenSys/surya) : generate graph, inheritance, markdown report, ...
- [Solgraph](https://github.com/raineorshine/solgraph): generates a [DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) graph that visualizes function control flow of a Solidity contract and highlights potential security vulnerabilities.
- [Sol2uml](https://github.com/naddison36/sol2uml):  generate an UML/Class diagram
- Auditor tool
  - [vscode-solidity-auditor](https://github.com/ConsenSys/vscode-solidity-auditor): Visual Studio Code extension contributing security centric syntax and semantic highlighting, a detailed class outline, specialized views, advanced Solidity code insights and augmentation to Visual Studio Code.
  - [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) to perform a static analysis on the smart contract and generate a vulnerability report.
  - [Mythril](https://github.com/Consensys/mythril) which uses symbolic execution, SMT solving and taint analysis to detect a variety of security vulnerabilities.

Why use these tools ?

- A good documentation allows other developers and users to better understand the code.
- it helps to find bugs and security issues inside the smart contract
- When a security audit is performed, it helps the auditor to understand the code.

[TOC]

## Solidity-docgen [OpenZeppelin]

[Solidity-docgen](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen)

> solidity-docgen is a program that extracts documentation for a Solidity project.

Installation

```
npm install solidity-docgen
```

You can use it as a standalone library or as a hardhat plugin

## Surya [ConsenSys]

[Surya](https://github.com/ConsenSys/surya)

> Surya is an utility tool for smart contract systems. It provides a  number of visual outputs and information about the contracts' structure. Also supports querying the function call graph in multiple ways to aid  in the manual inspection of contracts.

Installation:

```bash
npm install -g surya
```



Surya is also available with the VS Code extension: [vscode-solidity-auditor](https://github.com/ConsenSys/vscode-solidity-auditor) [https://github.com/ConsenSys/vscode-solidity-auditor]()



### Graph

The `graph` command outputs a DOT-formatted graph of the control flow.

### ftrace 

The `ftrace` command outputs a *treefied* function call trace stemming from the defined "CONTRACT::FUNCTION" and traversing "all/internal/external" types of calls.

### flatten

The `flatten` command outputs a flattened version of the  source code, with all import statements replaced by the corresponding  source code. "

### describe

The `describe` command shows a summary of the contracts and methods in the files provided.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4008213/48572168-97bfc780-e900-11e8-9e86-d265498de936.png)

### Inheritance

The `inheritance` command outputs a DOT-formatted graph of the inheritance tree.

### Dependencies

The `dependencies` command outputs the [c3-linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization) of a given contract's inheritance graph. 

### Parse

The `parse` command outputs a *treefied* AST object coming from the parser.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4008213/39415303-87df40de-4c39-11e8-8e03-ead72e88f1e3.png)

### mdreport

The `mdreport` command creates a Markdown description report  with tables comprising information about the system's files, contracts  and their functions.



### Solgraph

[Solgraph](https://github.com/raineorshine/solgraph)

An alternative to Surya to create a CFG graph is Solgraph.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raineorshine/solgraph/master/example.png)



Generates a [DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) graph that visualizes function control flow of a Solidity contract and highlights potential security vulnerabilities.

```bash
npx solgraph contracts/YOUR_CONTRACT.sol > YOUR_CONTRACT.dot
```

Convert the dot file in PNG

```bash
dot -Tpng YOUR_CONTRACT.dot -o YOUR_CONTRACT.png
```



## Sol2uml [naddison36]

[Sol2uml](https://github.com/naddison36/sol2uml)

> A visualisation tool for [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) contracts

It features:

- [Unified Modeling Language (UML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) [class diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram) generator for Solidity contracts.

- Contract storage layout diagrams.

Example:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naddison36/sol2uml/master/examples/OpenZeppelinERC20.svg)

### Alternative (plantuml)

- Run a Plantuml server on your local machine, see [github.com/plantuml/plantuml-server](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-server)

- Use plantuml inside VScode to generate an uml

This feature is directly available if you install the vscode extension [Solidity Visual Developer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tintinweb.solidity-visual-auditor)

![solidity-visual-auditor-uml]({{site.url_complet}}/assets/article/blockchain/ethereum/solidity/solidity-visual-auditor-uml.png)

## Solc Documentation output

> Generate NatSpec documentation

Solidity contracts can use a special form of comments to provide rich documentation for functions, return variables and more. This special form is named the Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format (NatSpec).

See [docs - natspec-format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html) for more information

When parsed by the compiler, documentation such as the one from the above example will produce two different JSON files. 

- user doc: this doc is meant to be consumed by the end user as a notice when a function is executed 

```bash
solc --userdoc ex1.sol
```

- dev doc:  this doc is meant to be consumed by the developer.

```bash
solc --devdoc ex1.sol
```

- User doc

- All

```
solc --devdoc ex1.sol
```



- With Foundry, `solc`can generate the following error: `Source "OZ/access/IAccessControl.sol" not found: File not found. Searched the following locations: "".`

To resolve this, you can pass the content of `remappings.txt`in the command:

```bash
solc OZ/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/ --userdoc src/ex1.sol 
```



## Auditor tool

### Aderyn [Cyfrin]

> Solidity static analyzer

Aderyn is an open-source public good developer tool. It is a Rust-based solidity smart contract static analyzer designed to help protocol engineers and security researchers find vulnerabilities in Solidity code bases.

```bash
aderyn --output aderyn-report.md
```

See [Cyfrin/aderyn](https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn)

### Mythril [ConsenSys]

[mythril](https://github.com/Consensys/mythril)

> Mythril is a security analysis tool for EVM bytecode. 

It uses symbolic execution, SMT solving and taint analysis to detect a variety of security vulnerabilities.

Usage

> ```bash
> myth analyze <solidity-file>
> ```

Since its used solc to compile the files, it is sometimes necessary to create a json file to map the libraries. Example for a project build with Foundry

```json
{
    "remappings": [ 
      "OZ/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/"
 ], "optimizer":{
    "enabled": true,
    "runs": 200
  }
}
```

The command is then:

```bash
 myth analyze <your contract> --solc-json solc_setting.json
```



### Slither [crytic]

[Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither)

> Slither is a very good tool to perform a static analysis on the smart contract and generate a vulnerability report.

Slither is a Solidity static analysis framework written in Python3. It runs a suite of vulnerability detectors, prints visual information about contract details, and provides an API to easily write custom analyses.

You can filter the libraries and test files to prevent them from also being analyzed by slither.

Example for a project build with Foundry

```
slither .  --checklist --filter-paths "openzeppelin-contracts|test|forge-std" > slither-report.md
```



### vscode-solidity-auditor [ConsenSys]

[vscode-solidity-auditor](https://github.com/ConsenSys/vscode-solidity-auditor)

> â€‹      Solidity language support and visual security auditor for Visual Studio Code

VScode solidity auditor is a swiss-knife which includes a varietiy of tools to analyze a contract and generate the documentation

It offers the following option: generate report, graph, inheritance, function signature, uml,...

It includes the tool Surya too.
