## Description

- About the Project

  - **OrderBook.sol:**
  
    The `OrderBook` contract is a peer-to-peer trading system designed for `ERC20` tokens like `wETH`, `wBTC`, and `wSOL`. Sellers can list tokens at their desired price in `USDC`, and buyers can fill them directly on-chain.

    The flow is simple:

    - Sellers lock their tokens and list an order with a price and deadline
    - Buyers purchase tokens by paying the listed `USDc` amount
    - if the order isn't filled before the deadline, sellers can cancel and retrieve their tokens
  
    All orders are tracked using a unique `orderId`, and sellers retain full control over their listings until filled or expired.
  
    Token transfers use `SafeERC20` to ensure secure movement of funds, and the system enforces a strict set of violation rules to prevent misuse.
  
    The contract also supports:
  
    - Amending orders (e.g. changing price or amount)
    - Canceling active or expired orders
    - Emergency withdrawals by the owner (for non-core tokens only)
    - human-readable order infor using `getOrderDetailsString`
  
  - **Features:**
  
    - Fixed-price order creation for selected `ERC20` tokens
    - Secure and gas-efficient architecture
    - Deadline enforcement to prevent stale listings
  
  - **Resources:**

### H01-No slippage protection in buyOrder

#### Root   + Impact



#### Description

- In normal operation, a buyer reads an order's `amountToSell` and `priceInUSDC` off-chain, and expects to buy that exact amount of tokens at that price.
- However, the seller can call `amendSellOrder()` before `buyOrder()` is executed, modifying `amountToSell` or `priceInUSDC` without buyer consent. This creates a **slippage risk**, where the buyer may overpay or receive fewer tokens than expected.



```soldiity
function buyOrder(uint256 _orderId) public {
        Order storage order = orders[_orderId];
        // Validation checks
        if (order.seller == address(0)) revert OrderNotFound();
        if (!order.isActive) revert OrderNotActive();
        if (block.timestamp >= order.deadlineTimestamp) revert OrderExpired();

        order.isActive = false;
        // @> use of priceInUSDC
        uint256 protocolFee = (order.priceInUSDC * FEE) / PRECISION;
        //  @> use of priceInUSDC
        uint256 sellerReceives = order.priceInUSDC - protocolFee;

        iUSDC.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), protocolFee);
		iUSDC.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, order.seller, sellerReceives);
        //  @>  use of order.amountToSell
        IERC20(order.tokenToSell).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.amountToSell);

        totalFees += protocolFee;

        emit OrderFilled(_orderId, msg.sender, order.seller);
        }
```



#### Risk

**Likelihood**:

- Sellers can amend their orders at any time before a buyer fills it.
- Buyers relying on off-chain reads cannot guarantee the state hasn’t changed by the time their transaction is mined.

**Impact**:

- Buyer receives fewer tokens than expected, losing value.
- Buyer pays more USDC than intended, enabling a **griefing or front-running** scenario.

#### Proof of Concept

\1) User see the order in the website app ui. For example
"500 wETH against 1000 USDC"

\2) User submits the transaction on-chain through l'UI

\3) While the transaction is on the mempool, the seller changes the amount, for ex. 1 wETH against 1000 USDC"

\4) When the first transaction is taken by a validor, the amount in wETH is now 1. As a result, the user will pay 1000 USDC for only 1 wETH.



#### Recommended Mitigation

Add two supplementary paramters in the function buyOrder: **uint256 expectedAmountToSell, uint256 expectedPriceInUSDC.**

In the function, check if their value match the value inside the order, otherwise revert.

```diff
\+ error SlippageOnAmount();

\+ error SlippageOnPrice();

\- function buyOrder(uint256 _orderId) public { 

\+ function buyOrder(uint256 _orderId, 

+uint256 expectedAmountToSell, uint256 expectedPriceInUSDC) public {  

if (!order.isActive) revert OrderNotActive(); 

\+ if (order.amountToSell != expectedAmountToSell) revert SlippageOnAmount(); 

\+ if (order.priceInUSDC != expectedPriceInUSDC) revert SlippageOnPrice();  

// rest of the code

### Mitigating Front-Running Vulnerabilities in DeFi

#### Root + Impact

#### Description

- Describe the normal behavior in one or more sentences -

  Attackers can exploit the public mempool to front-run amendSellOrder or cancelSellOrder transactions by submitting buyOrder transactions with higher gas prices, buying assets at outdated prices or before cancellation.
  This undermines the seller’s ability to update or cancel orders reliably.

- **Root Cause**:

  Blockchain transactions are visible in the public mempool before confirmation, allowing attackers to observe and outpace **amendSellOrder or cancelSellOrder calls**.
  The contract lacks mechanisms like time-locks or commit-reveal to obscure or delay these actions.

- Explain the specific issue or problem in one or more sentences

// Root cause in the codebase with @> marks to highlight the relevant section

#### Risk

**Likelihood**:

- Reason 1 - High likelihood due to easy mempool monitoring, automated MEV bots, and strong financial incentives in volatile markets.
- Reason 2 - No built-in protections make successful front-running attacks highly probable.

**Impact**:

- Impact 1 - Sellers face financial losses by selling at unintended prices or losing assets they meant to cancel, potentially in the thousands of USDC.
- Impact 2 - User trust and platform reputation suffer, risking reduced adoption and market inefficiency.



#### Recommended Mitigation -

### Protocol Suffers Potential Revenue Leakage due to Precision Loss in Fee Calculation

#### Summary

The protocol's fee calculation, which uses integer division with low precision (`/ 100`), creates a rounding error that can be exploited. For any trade priced at 33 wei of USDC or less, the calculated 3% fee rounds down to zero, allowing the trade to be processed fee-free. While the high gas cost of performing many small transactions makes a large-scale economic attack impractical today, this represents a fundamental design flaw that causes a **verifiable and permanent leakage of protocol revenue**. This flaw undermines the economic model and should be remediated as a matter of protocol robustness and best practice.

#### Finding Description

The `buyOrder` function calculates the protocol fee using the formula `(order.priceInUSDC * 3) / 100`. Due to Solidity's integer division, any result with a remainder is truncated. Consequently, if the numerator `(order.priceInUSDC * 3)` is less than `100`, the resulting `protocolFee` is `0`. This is true for any `priceInUSDC` value between 1 and 33.

// src/OrderBook.sol:203

uint256 protocolFee = (order.priceInUSDC * FEE) / PRECISION; // FEE = 3, PRECISION = 100

This creates a scenario where users can intentionally price their orders just below the 34 wei threshold to avoid fees. Although a single such transaction has a negligible impact, it establishes a pattern of value leakage that is built into the protocol's core logic.

#### Impact

The primary impact is a **direct, albeit small, loss of protocol revenue on certain trades**. While the economic viability of a large-scale attack is questionable due to gas costs, the existence of this flaw has several negative consequences:

- **Protocol Value Leak:** The protocol fails to capture fees it is entitled to, creating a small but persistent drain on its treasury.
- **Design Flaw:** It demonstrates a weakness in the handling of financial calculations. In DeFi, even minor rounding errors can be aggregated or combined with other exploits to cause significant issues.
- **Future Risk:** A reduction in L2 gas fees or the introduction of new protocol features could potentially make this exploit more economically viable in the future.

#### Likelihood

**Medium.** From a technical standpoint, the flaw is easy to trigger. Any user can create a low-priced order. However, the economic incentive to do so at scale is currently low, which reduces the practical likelihood of a major exploit.

#### Proof of Concept

The following test demonstrates that an order priced at 33 wei of USDC results in zero fees being collected by the protocol, confirming the rounding vulnerability.

**Successful Test Output:**

[PASS] test_PoC_SingleOrderFeeEvasion()

Logs:

  Price per order: 33

  Protocol fees collected for this trade: 0

The successful test confirms that it is possible to execute a trade without paying any fees, validating the existence of the revenue leakage flaw.

#### **Recommended Mitigation**

The standard industry practice to prevent such rounding issues is to increase the precision of the calculation by using basis points (1 bp = 0.01%).

```diff
// src/OrderBook.sol



\-    uint256 public constant FEE = 3; // 3%

\-    uint256 public constant PRECISION = 100;

\+    uint256 public constant FEE = 300; // 300 bps = 3.00%

\+    uint256 public constant PRECISION = 10000; // Represents 100.00%
```

**Impact of the Fix:**
With this change, the fee calculation becomes significantly more precise. While a price of 33 wei would still result in a zero fee (`(33 * 300) / 10000 = 0`), the threshold for earning a fee is much lower. For a more realistic low-value transaction of **1 USDC (1,000,000 wei)**, the fee would be:
`(1,000,000 * 300) / 10000 = 30,000 wei` (or 0.03 USDC).
This ensures that fees are collected fairly and consistently across almost all non-trivial trades, patching the revenue leak.
