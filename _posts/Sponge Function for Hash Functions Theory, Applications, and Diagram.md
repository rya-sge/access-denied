# Sponge Function for Hash Functions: Theory, Applications, and Diagram

## Introduction

In cryptography, **sponge functions** are versatile algorithms used to construct hash functions, stream ciphers, and random number generators. The main purpose of a sponge function is to process an arbitrary-length input to produce a fixed-length output. This construction enables the creation of hash functions that support flexible input and output lengths and have strong security properties. The most well-known example of a sponge-based hash function is **SHA-3**, the latest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family.

This article will explore the principles behind the sponge function, provide an example of its use in cryptographic hash functions, and include a PlantUML diagram for visualization.

## Sponge Function Basics

### Structure

A sponge function consists of three main components:

1. **State** (`S`): A large internal buffer divided into two parts, the **capacity** (`c`) and the **rate** (`r`).
2. **Absorbing Phase**: A phase where input data is absorbed into the state.
3. **Squeezing Phase**: A phase where output data is produced by squeezing the state.

The internal state, `S`, has a fixed length of `b = r + c`, where:

- `r` (rate) is the amount of data processed in each iteration.
- `c` (capacity) is the portion of the state reserved for internal security and prevents collisions in output.

### Step-by-Step Sponge Construction

A sponge function follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start with a zeroed internal state `S` of size `b = r + c`.

2. Absorbing:

   - Split the input message into chunks of `r` bits.
   - XOR each chunk with the first `r` bits of the state and apply a fixed transformation function `f` (e.g., a permutation).

3. **Padding**: If the message length isn’t a multiple of `r`, apply padding to make the final block fit the size.

4. Squeezing:

   - Output `r` bits of the state.
- If more output is needed, reapply the function `f` to generate additional output blocks.

## Mathematical Formulation of a Sponge Function

A sponge function for input `M` can be defined as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   $$
   S = 0^b
   $$
   
2. **Absorbing Phase**: For each message block `M_i` (where `M = M_1 || M_2 || ... || M_n` and `|M_i| = r`):
   $$
   S[:r] = S[:r] ⊕ M_i
   $$
   
   $$
   S = f(S)
   $$
   
3. **Squeezing Phase**: Repeat while more output is required:
   $$
   Z_i = S[:r]
   $$
   
   $$
   S = f(S)
   $$
   

The final output `Z` is a concatenation of `Z_i` blocks.

### Padding

To make the input fit into `r`-bit blocks, padding is applied to the message. The padding function is denoted by **pad** and ensures that the input is processed in complete blocks. One common padding scheme is the **multi-rate padding**, which appends a "1" followed by "0"s to the last block until it fits `r` bits.

## Example of Use: SHA-3

**SHA-3** (Keccak) is an example of a sponge-based hash function. For SHA-3:

1. **State Size**: `b = 1600` bits, with the rate and capacity depending on the desired hash output length.
2. **Rate and Capacity**: For SHA3-256 (256-bit output), `r = 1088` bits and `c = 512` bits.
3. **Transformation Function**: A permutation function `f` designed for Keccak, based on bitwise operations and rotations.

SHA-3 operates through the sponge structure by:

1.absorbing the message into the state with the XOR operation;

2.permuting the state;

3.and then squeezing out the output.

## Advantages and Security of Sponge Functions

Sponge functions are beneficial because they can be configured to provide high security based on their rate and capacity settings. They are resistant to attacks such as **collision attacks**, **pre-image attacks**, and **second pre-image attacks** if the capacity is chosen to be twice the desired security level (in bits).

### Security Properties

The following parameters influence the security of sponge functions:

- **Collision resistance**: Achieved if `c ≥ 2n`, where `n` is the number of bits of security desired.
- **Pre-image resistance**: Also influenced by capacity, making it challenging to reverse-engineer the input from the hash.

## Conclusion

Sponge functions are foundational structures in cryptographic functions, enabling the creation of hash functions, stream ciphers, and random number generators. Their flexibility in input/output length and security properties makes them a cornerstone in modern cryptography. The SHA-3 function family is a testament to the practical and robust nature of the sponge construction.
