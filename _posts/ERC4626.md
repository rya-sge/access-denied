## 1. The Execution Functions

You can call `deposit` to pass an amount of the underlying asset, e.g. DAI. The asset will be  transferred and in return you will receive shares, e.g. cDAI, in the  normal case determined by the current conversion rate.

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)
    external
    returns (uint256 shares);
```

Similarly to `deposit`, you can also use `mint`. Here instead of passing an amount of the underlying asset, you will  pass the amount of shares. And the amount of the underlying being used  and transferred will be determined when executing the call.

```solidity
function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver)
    external
    returns (uint256 assets);
```

You can then call `redeem` to convert shares back into the underlying asset. In redeem you will  pass the amount of shares to be burnt and the amount of the underlying  asset will be determined when executing the call.

```solidity
function redeem(
    uint256 shares,
    address receiver,
    address owner
  ) external returns (uint256 assets);
```

Like for the `deposit`/`mint`, you also have a second function here where instead you can pass the amount of assets you'd like to `withdraw`. And the amount of shares that have to be burnt will be determined when executing the call.
