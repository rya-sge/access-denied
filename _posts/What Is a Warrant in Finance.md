## **What Is a Warrant in Finance?**

A **warrant** is a financial security that grants its holder the **right, but not the obligation**, to buy (or sometimes sell) shares of a company at a predetermined **exercise price (strike price)** before a specified **expiration date**. Unlike exchange-traded stock options, warrants are **issued directly by the company**. When exercised, new shares are created, which can dilute existing shareholders.

Warrants are often used as a **sweetener** to make bonds or preferred stock more attractive to investors, or as a way to raise capital at favorable terms. They are leveraged instruments — small price movements in the underlying stock can translate into much larger changes in the value of the warrant.

## **Types of Warrants**

### **1. Call Warrants**

- **Right to buy** shares at a fixed price.
- The most common type of warrant.
- Profitable if the share price **rises above** the exercise price before expiration.

### **2. Put Warrants**

- **Right to sell** shares at a fixed price.
- Less common than call warrants.
- Profitable if the share price **falls below** the exercise price.

### **3. Detachable vs. Non-Detachable Warrants**

- **Detachable Warrants:** Can be separated from the bond or preferred share they were issued with and traded independently.
- **Non-Detachable Warrants:** Must remain attached to the security they came with — can’t be sold or exercised separately.

### **4. Covered vs. Naked Warrants**

- **Covered Warrant:** Issuer already owns the underlying shares or can easily acquire them.
- **Naked Warrant:** Issuer does not hold the shares beforehand, meaning they must issue or source them when exercised (common for company-issued warrants).

## **How Warrants Differ from Options**

Though both warrants and options provide the right to buy or sell shares at a fixed price, they are not the same instrument.

| Feature              | **Warrant**                                 | **Option**                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Issuer**           | Company itself                              | Investors/exchanges                                 |
| **Share Dilution**   | Yes, new shares are created                 | No, existing shares are used                        |
| **Lifespan**         | Long-term (1–10 years)                      | Short-term (weeks to ~2 years for LEAPS)            |
| **Standardization**  | Custom terms set by company                 | Standardized contracts (strike intervals, expiries) |
| **Market Liquidity** | Often low or OTC-traded                     | Highly liquid on major exchanges                    |
| **Valuation**        | Option pricing models + dilution adjustment | Standard option pricing models                      |

**In short:** *Options trade between investors; warrants come directly from the company. Options don't dilute existing shares; warrants do.*

## **Why Investors Use Warrants**

- **Leverage:** Control more shares with less upfront capital.
- **Long-Term Exposure:** Warrants often last several years, useful for strategic investors.
- **Deal Sweeteners:** Enhance the attractiveness of corporate bonds or preferred shares.

## **Risks to Consider**

- **Expiration risk:** Worthless if not exercised before maturity.
- **Dilution:** Exercise reduces per-share value for existing shareholders.
- **Lower liquidity:** Can be harder to trade than standard options.

------

**Bottom line:**
 Warrants are a flexible, company-issued derivative offering long-term exposure to a stock’s upside (or downside, for put warrants). While they resemble options, key differences in issuance, dilution, and structure make them a distinct financial product.
