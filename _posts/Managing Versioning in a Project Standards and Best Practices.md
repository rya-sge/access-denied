# Managing Versioning in a Project: Standards and Best Practices

## Introduction

Versioning is a critical aspect of software development, allowing teams to track changes, ensure compatibility, and communicate updates effectively. There are several norms and methodologies to follow when managing versions inside a project. This article explores versioning strategies, including major, minor, and patch updates, and best practices for maintaining proper documentation.

## Understanding Versioning: Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

One of the most widely adopted standards for versioning is **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**, which follows a structured format:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

### 1. Major Version

- A **major version** change (e.g., `1.0.0` → `2.0.0`) occurs when there are **breaking changes**.
- These changes might render previous versions incompatible.
- Examples: Removal of deprecated features, significant API redesigns, major structural changes.

### 2. Minor Version

- A **minor version** change (e.g., `1.1.0` → `1.2.0`) occurs when new **backward-compatible features** are added.
- It does not break existing functionalities.
- Examples: Adding new APIs, improving existing functionalities, performance enhancements.

### 3. Patch Version

- A **patch version** change (e.g., `1.1.1` → `1.1.2`) occurs when **backward-compatible bug fixes** or security patches are applied.
- Examples: Fixing security vulnerabilities, resolving minor bugs, documentation fixes.
- Warning: A library update (except if it is to fix vulnerabilities) should not be in a patch version (not necessarily backward compatible)

## Additional Versioning Considerations

While SemVer is widely used, other approaches may be appropriate depending on the project type:

### 1. Calendar Versioning (CalVer)

- Uses a **date-based** approach, such as `YYYY.MM.DD` or `YY.MM`
- Example: Ubuntu 22.04 (`YY.MM` format), where `22.04` refers to the April 2022 release.
- Ideal for projects with frequent releases or time-sensitive updates.

### 2. Incremental Versioning

- Uses simple sequential numbers (`1`, `2`, `3`, etc.)
- Often seen in **internal software** or beta versions.

## Managing Documentation Updates

Keeping version documentation up-to-date is crucial to avoid confusion and ensure smooth transitions between versions.

### 1. Changelog Maintenance

- Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` file outlining what changed in each release.
- Use clear categories such as **Added**, **Changed**, **Deprecated**, **Removed**, **Fixed**, and **Security**.

Example:

```
## [2.1.0] - 2024-02-20
### Added
- New user authentication API
- Support for WebSockets

### Fixed
- Resolved issue with database connection timeout
```

### 2. Versioning in API Documentation

- Clearly document deprecated features and breaking changes.
- Provide migration guides for major updates.
- Use API versioning (`/v1/`, `/v2/`) to maintain backward compatibility.

### 3. Codebase Versioning

- Use **Git tags** (`git tag v1.2.3`) to mark releases.
- Employ **branching strategies** such as GitFlow (`develop`, `feature`, `release`, `hotfix`).
- Automate versioning updates using CI/CD pipelines.

## Conclusion

Effective version management ensures software stability, improves user experience, and facilitates smooth updates. By following Semantic Versioning, maintaining changelogs, and integrating automated version control in CI/CD pipelines, teams can efficiently manage software evolution while keeping documentation clear and up to date.
