## Introduction

[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/) is a decentralized autonomous organization managing and issuing the **stablecoin** DAI, which is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US Dollar.

### Dai principle

Unlike traditional fiat-backed stablecoins that rely on a centralized entity to hold reserves, Dai is generated through a process called **collateralized debt positions (CDPs)**. Users lock up collateral, typically in the form of Ethereum (ETH), in a smart contract, and in return, they receive Dai. This process ensures that Dai is always backed by collateral, maintaining its stability.

## General concept

### Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs)

CDPs are at the core of MakerDAO's operation. When a user wants to generate Dai, they create a CDP by locking up a certain amount of collateral. The collateral is held in a smart contract, and based on the value of the collateral, a user can generate a specific amount of Dai. This mechanism allows users to access liquidity without having to sell their assets, providing a decentralized alternative to traditional lending platforms.

### Vaults and Stability Fee

The collateral held in CDPs is stored in MakerDAO's Vaults. 

For the old [Single-Collateral Dai](https://andytudhope.github.io/community/scd-faqs/stability-fee/) version, the mechanism can be described thus

The stability of Dai is maintained by adjusting the stability fee, an interest rate charged on the generated Dai. If the value of the collateral falls, the stability fee is increased, encouraging users to close their CDPs and reduce the circulating supply of Dai. This dynamic system helps to stabilize Dai and ensures that it remains pegged to the US Dollar.

For the new version which introduces the MCD system, you can read the documentation on [maker DAO](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/rates-module)

### Governance and MKR Token

MakerDAO operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning that the community plays a crucial role in decision-making. The governance of MakerDAO is facilitated through the MKR token, the native governance token of the platform. MKR holders have the power to vote on proposals that impact the protocol, such as changes to the stability fee, adding new collateral types, or modifying the parameters of the system.

## Liquidation example

Example with ETH = $3,000 and a collateral ratio required of 1.5

1) Deposit 1 ETH into Maker
1) Borow 1,000 DAI

Collateral ratio = 3'000 / 1'000 = 3

2. Price of Ether drops to $1,400
   1. Collateral ratio drops to 1.4 du to 1,400 / 1,000 = 1.4 < 1.5
   2. Take my 1 ETH and auction it off (dutch action)
   3. Raise enough DAI to pay back my borrow + liquiditation fee
   4. Leftover collateral send back to me (owner of the position that was liquidited)

## Smart contracts

List of the main smart contracts

| Contract                                                     | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Collateral Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/collateral-module) | The  collateral module is deployed for every new collateral type added to  **Vat**. It contains all the adapters and auction contracts for one specific collateral type. |
| [Core Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/core-module) | Contains the entire state of  the Maker Protocol and controls the central mechanisms of the system  while it is in the expected normal state of operation. One of its  primary components is the **Vat** contract. The core Vault, Dai, and  collateral state is kept in the Vat. |
| [Dai Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/dai-module) | Contains the DAI token contract and all its key functionalities. |
| [Emergency Shutdown Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/shutdown) | It has the ability to trigger the Shutdown of the Maker Protocol. |
| [Flash Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/flash-mint-module) | Allows anyone to mint Dai up to a limit set by Maker Governance with the one condition that they pay it  all back in the same transaction with a fee. It is very similar to the concept of *flashloan* |
| [Governance Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module) | Contains the contracts that facilitate MKR voting, proposal execution,  and voting security of the Maker Protocol. |
| [MKR Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/mkr-module) | Contains the MKR token, which is an ERC20 token that provides a standard ERC20 token interface. It also contains logic for burning and  authorized minting of MKR. |
| [Oracle Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/oracle-module) | An oracle module is deployed for each collateral type,  feeding it the price data for a corresponding collateral type to the  Vat. |
| [Proxy Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/proxy-module) | Contains contract interfaces, proxies, and  aliases to functions necessary for both DSR and Vault management and  Maker governance. |
| Peg Stability Module (PSM)                                   | Enables quick swapping  of DAI with other stablecoins at a rate of 1:1 by creating a pooled  collateralized-debt position with 100% collateralization ratio and 0%  stability fees. |
| [Rates Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/rates-module) | Accumulates stability fees on Vault debt balances, as well as interest on Dai Savings Rate (DSR) deposits. |
| [Shutdown](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/shutdown) | Stops and gracefully  settles the Maker Protocol while ensuring that all users, both Dai  holders and Vault holders, receive the net value of assets they are entitled to. |
| [System Stabilizer  Module](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/system-stabilizer-module) | Corrects the system when the value of the collateral backing Dai drops below the liquidation level (determined by governance) when the  stability of the system is at risk. |

## Secondary contracts

| Contract | Module     | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Vat      | CoreModule | The `Vat` is the core Vault engine of `dss`. It stores Vaults and tracks all the associated Dai and Collateral balances. It also defines the rules by which Vaults and balances can be manipulated.<br />The contract Vat is included in the Core Module contract |
| Spot     | CoreModule | The `Spot` liaison between the `oracles` and the core contracts. It functions as an interface contract and only stores the current `ilk` list. A ilk is a given collateral type |

## Risks and Challenges

MakerDao faces different challenges:

- Its reliance on Ethereum as the underlying blockchain exposes MakerDAO to network congestion and scalability issues.
- Additionally, the stability of Dai is contingent on the collateral backing it, and extreme market volatility can pose risks to the system.
