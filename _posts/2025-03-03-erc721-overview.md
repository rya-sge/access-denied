This article presents a global overview of [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) standard (NFT), covering its core functions, metadata, security best practices and how to use it with OpenZeppelin.

If you want to know more about the different standards and extensions to represent NFT, you can read my article [NFT Standards on Ethereum - ERC-721 and Beyond](https://rya-sge.github.io/access-denied/2025/01/14/ethereum-nft-standard/).

[TOC]

## Standard Overview

Every ERC-721 compliant contract must implement the `ERC721` and `ERC165` interfaces:

A quick summary from the [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)

| **Function/Event**                                           | **Description**                                              | Return type | **Remarks / Security Considerations**                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Transfer` (event)                                           | Emitted when an NFT is transferred, created (`from == 0`), or burned (`to == 0`). | -           | During contract creation, any number of NFTs may be created and assigned without emitting Transfer.<br / |
| `Approval` (event)                                           | Emitted when an NFT's approved address is changed or reaffirmed. | -           | The zero address indicates there is no approved address.     When a Transfer event emits, this also indicates that the approved  address for that NFT (if any) is reset to none. |
| `ApprovalForAll` (event)                                     | Emitted when an operator is enabled or disabled to manage all NFTs of an owner. | -           | -                                                            |
| `balanceOf(address _owner)`                                  | Returns the number of NFTs owned by an address.<br />Ensure `_owner` is a valid address; revert if it’s zero. | uint256     | It will revert if there is no owner !                        |
| `ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId)`                                  | Returns the owner of a specific NFT.<br />Ensure `_tokenId` exists; revert if it’s invalid. | address     | It will revert if there is no owner !                        |
| `safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data)` | Transfers an NFT, ensuring `_to` can handle ERC-721 tokens (via `onERC721Received`). | -           | Use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` to prevent tokens from being locked in contracts that don't implement `onERC721Received`.<br />Warning: adds a reentrancy-risk |
| `safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)` | Same as above but without the extra `data` parameter.        | -           | Preferred over `transferFrom` to prevent lost tokens in contracts. |
| `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)` | Transfers NFT ownership without checking if `_to` can handle it. | -           | **Risk of lost tokens!** Ensure `_to` is an EOA (Externally Owned Account) or a contract that supports ERC-721. |
| `approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId)`               | Approves another address to transfer a specific NFT.         | -           | --                                                           |
| `setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved)`       | Grants/revokes permission for an operator to manage all NFTs of the caller. | -           | Be careful when approving third-party operators (e.g., marketplaces) to prevent mass asset loss. |
| `getApproved(uint256 _tokenId)`                              | Returns the approved address for a specific NFT.             | address     | Ensure `_tokenId` exists to avoid reverting transactions.    |
| `isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator)`        | Returns whether an operator is approved for all NFTs of an owner. | bool        | Regularly check operator approvals to avoid unauthorized transfers. |
| `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID)` (ERC165)             | Checks if a contract implements a specific interface (e.g., ERC-721). | bool        | Required for ERC-721 compliance. Ensures compatibility with other smart contracts. |

### ERC-721 Token Receiver Interface (`ERC721TokenReceiver`)

A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the **wallet interface** if it will accept safe transfers.

The **ERC721TokenReceiver** interface is crucial for **smart contracts** that intend to **receive ERC-721 tokens** securely. It ensures that the recipient contract can handle NFTs properly and prevents tokens from getting stuck in incompatible contracts.

| **Function**                                                 | **Description**                                              | Return type | **Technical Details & Security Considerations**              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `onERC721Received(address _operator, address _from, uint256 _tokenId, bytes _data) → bytes4` | Handles the receipt of an NFT when `safeTransferFrom()` is used. Must return a specific magic value to confirm acceptance. | bytes4      | - **MUST return** `0x150b7a02` (`bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))`) or the transaction will **revert**. <br />- Called by the NFT contract on `_to` (receiver contract).<br /> - The `_operator` is the sender (could be an approved operator). <br />- If the recipient contract does **not** implement this function or returns an incorrect value, the transfer **fails**. |

### Metadata

The **metadata extension** is OPTIONAL for ERC-721 smart contracts-

This allows your smart contract to be interrogated for its name and for details about the assets which your NFTs represent.

### ERC-721 Metadata Extension Function Reference Table

| **Function**                 | **Description**                                              | Return type | **Remarks / Security Considerations**                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name()`                     | Returns the descriptive name of the NFT collection.          | string      | The name should be immutable or only modifiable by the contract owner to prevent misleading changes. It should ideally not be modified to maintain consistency. |
| `symbol()`                   | Returns the symbol (ticker) of the NFT collection.           | string      | Similar to `name()`, it should be set at deployment or only modifiable by the contract owner to prevent misleading changes. It should ideally not be modified to maintain consistency. |
| `tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId)` | Returns a unique URI for a given NFT, typically pointing to metadata (e.g., JSON file with image, description, attributes).<br />URIs are defined in RFC 3986.<br /> Revert if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT.<br /> The URI may point to a JSON file that conforms to the "ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema". | string      | Ensure `_tokenId` exists before returning a URI to prevent invalid lookups, otherwise revert<br />Use **IPFS or Arweave** instead of centralized servers to ensure metadata immutability and prevent broken links.

## Build NFT contract

### Minimum function

If you use [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721) as the core library, the majority of ERC-721 functions are already implemented. There are nevertheless several functions, not directly part of ERC-721 standard, which could be relevant to add depending of your use case:

- `Mint`, eventually `burn`
- Access control or ownership system to protect your sensitive functions (e.g mint/burn)
- `setBaseUri`: to set the base URI, common for all tokens URI
- `baseURI()`: getter to return Base URI for computing {tokenURI}. If set, the resulting URI for each  token will be the concatenation of the `baseURI` and the `tokenId`.  OpenZeppelin only provides the internal function `_baseURI()`which can not be called outside of the NFT contract.

### Mint

With `OpenZeppelin`, the internal function `_mint` is not recommended and it is preferable to use ` _safeMint` instead.

`_safeMint`will check if the recipient of the newly created NFT is an EOA or a smart contract.

If it is a contract, the function will check that the contract implements the interface `IERC721Receiver` which indicates that this contract can manage ERC-721 token.

See [docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_mint-address-uint256-](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_mint-address-uint256-)

## Security

### Transfer

#### safeTransferFrom

If you build a contract to manage and transfer NFT, e.g an NFT marketplace:

- If the contract calls [**.(safe)transferFrom**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67383742), then in the majority of cases **from** parameter must be [**msg.sender**](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/is-there-any-standard-to-let-msg-sender-reveal-delayed-nft/34118). Otherwise an attacker can take advantage of other user’s [appovals](https://revoke.cash/) and steal their NFT from them! Same principle with a call using  [**.transferFrom**](https://veridelisi.medium.com/learn-erc20-in-solidity-transferfrom-function-ceb0a304163)
- Warning: the **OpenZeppelin** implementation of [**ERC721**](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.4/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L389) and [**ERC1155**](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L476) vulnerable to [**reentrancy**](https://blog.pessimistic.io/reentrancy-attacks-on-smart-contracts-distilled-7fed3b04f4b6) attacks, since [**safeTransferFrom**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67383742) functions perform an external call to the user address (**onReceived**)!

Main reference: [Pessimistic - Auditing Tips for NFT Projects](https://blog.pessimistic.io/auditing-tips-for-nft-projects-355872213848)

#### Transfer and TransferFrom

OpenZeppelin recommand to use `safeTransferFrom`instead even if it adds a reentrancy risk

>  Note that the caller is responsible to confirm that the recipient is capable of receiving ERC-721 or else they may be permanently lost. Usage of [`safeTransferFrom`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-safeTransferFrom-address-address-uint256-) prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability

See [docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-]( https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-)

And [Quillhash - NFT-Attack-Vectors/blob/main/data/16.md](https://github.com/Quillhash/NFT-Attack-Vectors/blob/main/data/16.md)

### Approval/allowance

For ERC-20 token, if a token holder wants to update the amount approved to a specific spender, there is the possibility for this spender to front-run the approval by spending the approval before the new approval is set, see [ERC20 API: An Attack Vector on the Approve/TransferFrom Methods](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/)-

ERC-721 is less concerned by this problem because each NFT is unique, the approval quantity is none or one. However, if a token holder wants to revoke the approval given to a spender, there is however always the possibility for this spender to spend the approval before it is approved on the blockchain (front-running).

### ERC721 detector

#### Aderyn - IncorrectERC721InterfaceDetector

Aderyn has a detector to check if the ERC-721 interface is correctly implemented or not.

https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn/blob/aderyn-v0.5.8/aderyn_core/src/detect/high/incorrect_erc721_interface.rs

The detector will notably check the following thing:

- The return type for each function
- If the signature match the interface

Here a summary tab for the return value:

| ERC-721 Function                                             | Expected Return Type | Problem if not                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `balanceOf(address owner)`                                   | `uint256`            | If it doesn't return `uint256`, it's captured. |
| `getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`                               | `address`            | If it doesn't return `address`, it's captured. |
| `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`                                   | `address`            | If it doesn't return `address`, it's captured. |
| `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)` | no return (void)     | If it returns anything, it's captured.         |
| `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`    | no return (void)     | If it returns anything, it's captured.         |
| `approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`                       | no return (void)     | If it returns anything, it's captured.         |
| `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`         | no return (void)     | If it returns anything, it's captured.         |
| `isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator)`          | `bool`               | If it doesn't return `bool`, it's captured.    |

## Example

This example is a very simple basic NFT contract with only a mint function, the possibility to put in pause the contract and an access control with an ownership system.

To define the tokenId of an NFT, the contract use a counter (`tokenId`) which is incremented afer the mint.

## Error management (ERC-6093)

OpenZeppelin implements for their ERC-721 implementation since the version 5.0.0 the standard [eip-6093](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6093) created by their team.

This EIP defines a standard set of custom errors for commonly-used tokens, notably [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) tokens.
