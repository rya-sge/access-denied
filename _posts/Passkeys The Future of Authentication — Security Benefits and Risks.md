# **Passkeys: The Future of Authentication — Security Benefits and Risks**

In the evolving landscape of digital security, **passkeys** are emerging as a promising alternative to traditional passwords. Developed under the **FIDO2** standard and supported by tech giants like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, passkeys aim to eliminate phishing, password reuse, and credential stuffing — problems that plague traditional authentication systems.

------

## **What Are Passkeys?**

A **passkey** is a cryptographic credential, typically composed of a **key pair**: a **public key**, which is stored on the server, and a **private key**, which stays securely on the user's device. Passkeys are tied to biometric authentication (like Face ID, Touch ID, or Windows Hello) or device PINs, making them highly user-friendly and secure.

They use **WebAuthn**, a standard API that enables public-key-based authentication on the web.

## **How Do Passkeys Work?**

1. **Registration**:
   - User registers on a site or app.
   - A new public-private key pair is generated.
   - The **public key** is sent to the server and stored.
   - The **private key** stays on the device, protected by the device’s secure enclave or TPM (Trusted Platform Module).
2. **Authentication**:
   - The server sends a **challenge** to the client.
   - The client signs it with the private key after biometric/PIN verification.
   - The server verifies the signature using the public key.

No secrets are transmitted or stored server-side, significantly reducing attack surfaces

## **Security Benefits**

### Resistance to Phishing

Passkeys are **origin-bound**, meaning they won’t work on lookalike or malicious websites. This mitigates phishing attacks effectively.

### No Shared Secrets

Unlike passwords, passkeys are never reused or exposed in transit or at rest on servers. Even if the server is compromised, the attacker gets only the public key.

### Multi-Device Support with Syncing

Platforms like iCloud Keychain and Google Password Manager allow passkeys to sync securely across devices using end-to-end encryption.

### User Experience

Logging in with a passkey can be faster and more seamless than typing a password — a single biometric scan is enough.

------

## **Security Risks and Challenges**

### Device Lock-in

Passkeys are stored on user devices. If users lose access and haven't synced or backed them up (e.g., via iCloud or Google Account), they may be locked out.

### Cloud Sync Risks

While passkey syncing is encrypted, if an attacker gains access to the cloud account (e.g., via SIM swap or account recovery exploit), they could potentially access the synced keys.

### Adoption Lag

While major platforms support passkeys, adoption across all websites and services is slow. Many still require passwords, leading to hybrid environments that reintroduce vulnerabilities.

### Advanced Threats

A compromised device (via malware or root/jailbreak) could potentially access the private key or override biometric prompts. Endpoint security remains vital.

## **Real-World Examples**

### **Apple Ecosystem**

Apple introduced passkeys in iOS 16 and macOS Ventura. Users can sign into supported websites like Best Buy or eBay using Face ID or Touch ID. Passkeys are synced via iCloud Keychain with end-to-end encryption.

### **Google Accounts**

Google allows users to sign in using passkeys stored in their Google Password Manager. Passkeys work across devices if sync is enabled and users are signed in to the same Google account.

### **PayPal**

PayPal has enabled passkey support for accounts in the U.S., offering login via biometric scan instead of passwords — a significant usability and security upgrade.

## **Conclusion**

**Passkeys represent a transformative step forward** in authentication — offering strong protection against phishing, credential theft, and user friction. However, as with any new tech, they come with transitional challenges and implementation risks.

Organizations should:

- Encourage users to adopt passkeys.
- Provide fallback options securely.
- Harden endpoint devices and cloud accounts.

As support grows, passkeys could help move the web toward a truly **passwordless future** — one that’s more secure and user-friendly.
