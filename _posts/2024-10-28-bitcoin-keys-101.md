This article explains the generation of private keys in Bitcoin until obtaining a public address and the different type of addresses available.

[TOC]

## General workflow

The basic worklow is the following

1.Generate the seed phrase

Note: this is not a required step, you can directly generate the private key, but this is a standard practice in Bitcoin Wallets, defined in [BIP-39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).

More information in my article: [Bitcoin Keys 102: How Wallets Generate Seed Phrases and Private Keys](https://rya-sge.github.io/access-denied/2025/03/27/bitcoin-keys-102/)

2.Create a private key

3.Compute the public key

4.Derive the Bitcoin address from the public key

## Create a Bitcoin address

### Create a Legacy Bitcoin Address

#### Private key generation

- A private key is generated randomly. It is a 256-bit number that serves as the secret key for spending Bitcoin from the address it generates.
- In Bitcoin, this is often done using a secure pseudorandom number generator to ensure privacy and security.

#### Public key generation

Using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), specifically the secp256k1 curve in Bitcoin, the private key is used to generate a corresponding public key.

y2 = x3 + 7
\end{aligned}
$$

- This public key is a 512-bit number (or 64 bytes in hexadecimal format).

#### Hash

- **Perform SHA-256 Hashing on the Public Key**:

The public key is hashed using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, producing a 256-bit hash.

- **Apply RIPEMD-160 Hashing**:

The result from the SHA-256 hash is then hashed using the RIPEMD-160 hashing algorithm, which produces a 160-bit (20 bytes) output. This is called the *Public Key Hash (PKH)*.

#### Add a Version Byte

A version byte is added to the beginning of the Public Key Hash. For standard Bitcoin addresses, this version byte is `0x00` (or `00` in hexadecimal). The purpose of the version byte is to help distinguish address types.

| Type                                       | Version prefix (hex) | Base58 result prefix |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Address for pay to public key hash (P2PKH) | 0x00                 | 1                    |
| Address for pay to script hash (P2SH)      | 0x05                 | 3                    |
| Testnet Address for P2PKH                  | 0x6F                 | m or n               |
| Testnet Address for P2SH                   | 0xC4                 | 2                    |
| Private Key WIF                            | 0x80                 | 5, K, or L           |
| BIP32 Extended Public Key                  | 0x0488B21E           | xpub                 |

#### Calculate the Checksum

- The versioned Public Key Hash is then double-hashed using SHA-256.

- The first 4 bytes of this second hash become the *checksum*, which is appended to the end of the versioned Public Key Hash.

  

#### Encode in Base58

The resulting byte sequence (versioned Public Key Hash + checksum) is encoded using `Base58Check` encoding, resulting in a human-readable Bitcoin address.
$$
Base58Check(Versioned Public Key hash||checksum)
$$
This process generates a string, such as `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`, which is the Bitcoin address.

### P2SH details

From [bip-0013](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0013.mediawiki)

This bitcoin address type is constructed in the same manner as legal bitcoin addresses  with [Base58Check encoding](https://en.bitcoin.it/Base58Check_encoding):

```
    base58-encode: [one-byte version][20-byte hash][4-byte checksum]
```

- Version byte is 5 for a main-network address, 196 for a testnet address. 

- The 20-byte hash is the hash of the script that will be used to redeem the coins. 
- And the 4-byte checksum is the first four bytes of the double SHA256 hash of the version and hash.

## Variation

### Native SegWit (Bech32)

**Bech32** is a [segwit](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit) address format specified by [BIP 0173](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0173) (Bech32) and [BIP 0350](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0350) (Bech32m). This address format is also known as "bc1 addresses". This type of address is considered as more efficient (so lower fees) than a traditionnal legacy addresss because it uses less block space.

The main difference is that the encodage algorithm used is `Bech32` instead of `Base58Check` for a legacy address.

**Format:** Starts with `bc1q...`

**How it's created:**

- Same initial steps as Legacy (generate pubkey, hash it with SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160)
- These operation gives an array of 8-bit unsigned integers (base 2^8=256) 

Then:

- Encode it using **Bech32**  which converts the hash value to an array of 5-bit unsigned integers
- Add the witness version byte (`0`)  in front of the previous step
- Compute the checksum by using the data from previous step and the network identifier (bc for MainNet and tb for TestNet) and append it to the previous step
- ...and some additional steps explained [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32)
