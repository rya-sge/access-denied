This article is a deep dive into the generation of private keys until obtaining a public address through the main related BIPs: BIP-32 and BIP-39

In short, this article explains how to create a bitcoin private key, compute its public key and derived its address.

[TOC]



## Basic workflow

The basic worklow is the following

1) Generate the seed phrase
2) Create a private key
3) Compute the public key
4) Derive the Bitcoin address from the public key

## BIP-39: seed phrase

Author: Marek Palatinus, Pavol Rusnak, Aaron Voisine, Sean Bowe

[bip-0039.mediawiki](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)

This BIP describes the implementation of a mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence -- a group of easy to remember words -- for the generation of deterministic wallets.

It consists of two parts:

-  generating the seed phrase
- converting it into a binary seed. 



This seed can be later used to generate deterministic wallets using BIP-0032 or similar methods.

### Schema

### Why 24 words instead of 12 ?

24 words, instead of 12, is also used in practice. But is it really useful ?

Their goal of this greater entropy is to make more difficult to compute the whole seed phase if you know part of the seed phrase

If an attacker knowns:

-  half of a 128-bit code (64 bits), it’s plausible that they’ll be able to brute force the remaining 64 bits.

- half of a 256-bit code (128 bits), it’s not plausible that they can brute force the other half.

The 24-words was also used by Trezor against a keylogger. Since you have to use the interface, a keylooger could know all the seed words but not the order. In that case 24 words is much safer. At least  that's true for the Trezor.

## BIP-32

### BIP-32 HD key derivation

| Standard | Script          | BIP32 path    |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| BIP44    | P2PKH           | `m/44'/0'/0'` |
| BIP49    | Nested P2WPKH   | `m/49'/1'/0'` |
| BIP84    | P2WPKH          | `m/84'/0'/0'` |
| BIP86    | P2TR Single-key | `m/86'/0'/0'` |

## Create a Bitcoin address

### Create a Legacy Bitcoin Address

1. Generate a Private Key**:

   - A private key is generated randomly. It is a 256-bit number that serves as the secret key for spending Bitcoin from the address it generates.
   - In Bitcoin, this is often done using a secure pseudorandom number gener![Bitcoin-address-bitcoin address.drawio]({{site.url_complet}}/assets/article/blockchain/bitcoin/Bitcoin-address-bitcoin address.drawio.png)ator to ensure privacy and security.

   

2. **Generate the Public Key**:

   Using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), specifically the secp256k1 curve in Bitcoin, the private key is used to generate a corresponding public key.

   **ecp256k1's elliptic curve**
   $$
    y2 = x3 + 7 
   $$
   ![Secp256k1]({{site.url_complet}}/assets/article/blockchain/bitcoin/Secp256k1.png)

   - This public key is a 512-bit number (or 64 bytes in hexadecimal format).

3. **Perform SHA-256 Hashing on the Public Key**:

   The public key is hashed using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, producing a 256-bit hash.

4. **Apply RIPEMD-160 Hashing**:

   The result from the SHA-256 hash is then hashed using the RIPEMD-160 hashing algorithm, which produces a 160-bit (20 bytes) output. This is called the *Public Key Hash (PKH)*.

5. **Add a Version Byte**:

   A version byte is added to the beginning of the Public Key Hash. For standard Bitcoin addresses, this version byte is `0x00` (or `00` in hexadecimal). The purpose of the version byte is to help distinguish address types.

   | Type                                       | Version prefix (hex) | Base58 result prefix |
   | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------- |
   | Address for pay to public key hash (P2PKH) | 0x00                 | 1                    |
   | Address for pay to script hash (P2SH)      | 0x05                 | 3                    |
   | Testnet Address for P2PKH                  | 0x6F                 | m or n               |
   | Testnet Address for P2SH                   | 0xC4                 | 2                    |
   | Private Key WIF                            | 0x80                 | 5, K, or L           |
   | BIP32 Extended Public Key                  | 0x0488B21E           | xpub                 |

6. **Calculate the Checksum**:

   - The versioned Public Key Hash is then double-hashed using SHA-256.
   - The first 4 bytes of this second hash become the *checksum*, which is appended to the end of the versioned Public Key Hash.

7. **Encode in Base58**:

The resulting byte sequence (versioned Public Key Hash + checksum) is encoded using Base58Check encoding, resulting in a human-readable Bitcoin address.
$$
Base58Check(Versioned Public Key hash||checksum)
$$
This process generates a string, such as `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`, which is the Bitcoin address.
