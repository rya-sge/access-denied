# SteakHouse Finance

Initially established as core contributors to the Sky (f.k.a. MakerDAO) ecosystem, Steakhouse has gone on to become the premier DeFi advisory firm working with some of the largest protocols, including Lido, Morpho, Ethena, ENS, Arbitrum, and more.

Steakhouse has deep expertise in credit underwriting, as well as RWA structuring & advisory, having made invaluable contributions to the growth of the RWA ecosystem at Sky, including spearheading [the initiative](https://forum.sky.money/t/request-for-proposal-rfp-tokenized-money-market-fund-short-duration-us-t-bill-asset-managers-for-sparkdao/24884) to underwrite and purchase over $1bn of Tokenized RWAs.



The Steakhouse team was founded by DAO contributors, for DAO contributors. We are leaders in blockchain-based financial reporting, and created some of the first widely used [blockchain-based financial statements](https://dune.com/steakhouse/makerdao) and [financial reports dating back to early 2021](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/financial-report-2021-03/7286). We actively report on and monitor MakerDAO’s >$2.5bn RWA portfolio and protocol financials, as well as [ENS’s >$100mm endowment](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-financial-reporting-by-steakhouse/16601/21).

### Proposal

#### RWA-backed Steakhouse USDC MetaMorpho Vault

Proposal date: November 9, 2023

The inaugural USDC vault curated by Steakhouse Financial will initially lend against tokenized T-bills, namely Backed Finance’s bIB01. bIB01 is an ERC-20 token backed by IB01 ([Blackrock’s iShares 0-1 yr US Treasury ETF](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/307243/ishares-treasury-bond-0-1yr-ucits-etf)). Suppliers to the vault can earn a passive yield by lending their USDC to over-collateralized borrowers, who in turn provide bIB01 as collateral for their loans.

#### Introducing the Smokehouse product line: bbqUSDC and bbqDAI

Smokehouse vaults are for frontiersmen and women who are not afraid of exotic collateral types. It will use a wide range of collateral to allow vaults to be exposed to the most diverse possible types of borrowing activity. Like all our vaults, it is non-custodial and users should perform their risk analysis by themselves before depositing.

The Smokehouse vault keeps all the great features of other Steakhouse vaults:

- 3-day timelock allowing people to exit if a new collateral is not fitting their risk tolerance
- On-chain Aragon DAO Guardians to allow all depositors to veto any significant action made by the curator:
  - [bbqUSDC guardian](https://app.aragon.org/#/daos/ethereum/bbqusdc-guardian.dao.eth/dashboard)
  - [bbqDAI guardian](https://app.aragon.org/#/daos/ethereum/bbqdai-guardian.dao.eth/dashboard)
- State of the art programmatic reallocation system

## MakerDAO / SKY

### Grove (Sky)

Steakhouse Financial is building `Grove`, an institutional-grade credit protocol to unlock USDS's full potential by bridging DeFi and traditional finance. 

It will enable Sky to scale offchain credit, create new farming opportunities, and offer USDS holders better savings rates with diversified real-world assets. 

Its main product is `Grove Allocator`: 

- Grove allocator integrated directly with a wide range of tokenized assets extending the reach of DeFi to major institutions, scalable RWAs, and frontier DeFi protocols.
- Optimized yield: The Grove Allocation layer aggregates yields across a growing list of on-chain and off-chain tokenized assets.
