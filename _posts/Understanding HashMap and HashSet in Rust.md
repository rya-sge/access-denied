# Understanding `HashMap` and `HashSet` in Rust

Rust provides powerful and efficient collections as part of its standard library. Two commonly used collections are `HashMap` and `HashSet`. Both use hashing internally, making them suitable for scenarios where fast lookup, insertion, and deletion are required.

## What is a `HashMap`?

A `HashMap<K, V>` stores a mapping from keys of type `K` to values of type `V`. It uses a hashing algorithm to allow quick access to values based on their keys.

### Example: Using `HashMap` in Rust

```
rustCopyEdituse std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert("Alice", 90);
    scores.insert("Bob", 85);

    // Accessing a value
    if let Some(score) = scores.get("Alice") {
        println!("Alice's score is {}", score);
    }

    // Iterating over the map
    for (key, value) in &scores {
        println!("{}: {}", key, value);
    }

    // Updating a value
    scores.entry("Alice").and_modify(|score| *score += 5);
    println!("Updated Alice's score: {}", scores["Alice"]);
}
```

## What is a `HashSet`?

A `HashSet<T>` is a collection of unique values of type `T`. It's a wrapper around a `HashMap<T, ()>`, which makes it efficient for checking membership.

### Example: Using `HashSet` in Rust

```
rustCopyEdituse std::collections::HashSet;

fn main() {
    let mut fruits = HashSet::new();

    fruits.insert("apple");
    fruits.insert("banana");
    fruits.insert("orange");

    // Check membership
    if fruits.contains("banana") {
        println!("We have bananas!");
    }

    // Iterate through the set
    for fruit in &fruits {
        println!("{}", fruit);
    }
}
```

## Bad Example: Misusing `HashMap`

A common mistake when using `HashMap` is assuming that accessing a non-existent key returns a default value rather than `None`. This can lead to runtime panics.

```
rustCopyEdituse std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    scores.insert("Alice", 90);

    // BAD: This will panic if "Bob" is not in the map
    let score = scores["Bob"];
    println!("Bob's score is {}", score);
}
```

### Why It's Bad:

- Using the `[]` indexing syntax expects the key to exist and will panic if it doesn't.
- Instead, use `.get()` and handle the `Option`:

```
rustCopyEditif let Some(score) = scores.get("Bob") {
    println!("Bob's score is {}", score);
} else {
    println!("No score found for Bob.");
}
```

## Performance Tips

- Use `HashMap::with_capacity(n)` if you know the approximate size ahead of time to avoid reallocation.
- Consider `BTreeMap` or `BTreeSet` if you need ordered elements or range queries.

## Conclusion

`HashMap` and `HashSet` are fundamental tools in Rust's collection toolbox. When used properly, they offer fast, efficient ways to store and retrieve data. Always handle potential missing keys gracefully and remember that `HashSet` is your go-to for unique items.
