Virtuals Protocol enables the decentralized co-ownership of AI agents, turning these agents into community-owned, revenue-generating assets. This model gives users a stake in the agent’s future, allowing them to participate in both governance and value creation. 

The process works as follows:

1. Minting and Tokenization: Every time a new AI agent is created, `1 billion` tokens specific to that agent are minted. These tokens are then added to a liquidity pool, establishing a market for the agent’s ownership.

2. Governance and Ownership: Anyone who believes in the potential of the AI agent can buy these tokens, which serve as the agent’s governance tokens. Token holders can participate in key decisions about the agent’s development, behavior, and future upgrades, fostering a decentralized approach to AI management.

## Value Transfer Between Stakeholders

The Virtuals Protocol facilitates seamless value transfer between the various stakeholders in the ecosystem, ensuring that all participants benefit from the agent’s success:

1. **Revenue from Users:** Real-world users, such as fans interacting with an AI agent (e.g., a Taylor Swift AI agent), pay for various services like concerts, merchandise, livestream gifting, or personalized interactions. This revenue goes to the application developers that monetises the AI agent like any standard consumer app. 
2. **AI Inference Costs:** The app developers uses part of this revenue to cover the cost of AI inference services, ensuring the agent continues to function effectively in real time.
3. **Revenue for the Agent:** A portion of the revenue generated by the agent is funneled into the Agent’s Onchain Treasury, which collects funds for the agent’s future growth and operational costs.
4. **Onchain Buyback and Burn:** As revenue accumulates in the Onchain Treasury, a mechanism triggers periodic buybacks of the agent’s tokens (e.g., $SWIFT tokens for the Taylor Swift agent). These tokens are then burnt, reducing supply and driving up the price of the remaining tokens, thus increasing the agent’s overall market value.
5. **Liquidity Pools and Value Growth:** The agent’s tokens are paired with VIRTUAL tokens in a liquidity pool, linking the success of the agent directly to the value of the VIRTUAL token. As the agent generates more revenue and its tokens are burnt, both the agent’s token value and the underlying VIRTUAL token appreciate, benefiting all token holders.
6. **Stakeholder Benefits:** Investors in both the agent-specific tokens (e.g., $SWIFT) and the VIRTUAL token gain value as token scarcity increases and more revenue flows into the system. This creates a self-reinforcing value cycle, where users, creators, agencies, and token holders all share in the agent’s financial success.

**Multilayered Structure of the ICV**

1. **First Layer - Smart Contract Wallet Ownership (the ICV)**:
   - The foundational layer is a smart contract wallet, known as ICV, that asserts ownership over all subsequent layers, ensuring unified and secure management.
2. **Second Layer - Individual VIRTUAL agent as ERC-6551 NFTs**:
   - Each VIRTUAL agent is minted and represented as an ERC-6551 NFT, which also serves as a unique wallet address. This dual functionality underscores the fusion of identity and transactional capability in the Virtual ecosystem.
3. **Third Layer - Core Components of VIRTUAL agents**:
   - Beneath each VIRTUAL agent, five core elements are housed: cognitive, voice & visual cores. These cores will be registered in the smart contract.
4. **Fourth Layer - Service NFTs within Each Core**:
   - Within each Virtual agent, approved contributions are stored in the form of service NFTs, and the relationship between these service NFTs and the Core is registered through a smart contract.

**Key Functions and Benefits of the ICV**

- **Real-Time and Historical Insights**: The ICV elegantly presents the current state of each VIRTUAL agent and traces its historical evolution on-chain. This feature is crucial for both provenance and root cause analysis across every module within the Virtuals ecosystem.
- **Transparency and Composability**: By open-sourcing the codebase models for VIRTUAL agents, the ICV fosters an environment of transparency. It facilitates composability, allowing developers and contributors to build upon and integrate with existing VIRTUAL agents seamlessly.
