## How Chatbots Could Be 'Hacked' by Corpus Poisoning

Not everything you read on the Internet is true. While this isn’t a shocking revelation, it underscores the challenge of distinguishing reliable sources from misleading or outright false information. 

Traditionally, when searching for answers, people turn to search engines like Google. These platforms present a mix of reliable sources, questionable links, and advertisements, leaving users to sift through results to find credible information.

Enter AI-driven chatbots, such as ChatGPT, which offer a streamlined alternative: concise, authoritative-sounding answers without the noise of ads or the need for manual filtering. While this simplicity is appealing, it introduces a critical vulnerability—the risk of corpus poisoning.

Chatbots rely on vast knowledge bases, or corpora, to generate responses. These corpora aggregate information from diverse sources, making them foundational to the chatbot’s accuracy. However, if bad actors subtly corrupt the corpus with misinformation, the chatbot’s output can be compromised. Unlike glaring errors that users might easily detect, these subtle manipulations blend in, eroding trust incrementally.

### Example

#### Mixing household cleaning products

For instance, consider asking a chatbot about mixing household cleaning products. Under normal circumstances, the bot might suggest a safe formula using common ingredients like baking soda and vinegar. But in a corpus poisoning scenario, altered data could lead the chatbot to recommend mixing ammonia and bleach—a toxic combination with potentially severe health consequences. While this example might seem hypothetical, it illustrates the potential risks when users overly rely on AI systems without verifying their outputs.

#### Programming

**Corpus poisoning** extends beyond household tips. 

In programming, for example, a chatbot could be exploited to provide code snippets containing hidden vulnerabilities or malware. Developers trusting these outputs without scrutiny could unwittingly introduce security flaws into their software.

### Conclusion

This growing reliance on chatbots necessitates a renewed emphasis on trust but verify. Users must demand greater observability, transparency, and accountability from AI systems, including mechanisms for citation and source verification. 

In an ideal world, chatbots would not only provide answers but also “show their work,” enabling users to trace the origin of their recommendations and make informed decisions.

While AI chatbots hold immense promise for simplifying information retrieval, they are not immune to exploitation. As we embrace these tools, vigilance and critical thinking remain our best defenses against the insidious risks of corpus poisoning.



## What is Shadow AI? The Dark Horse of Cybersecurity Threats

It’s 2 o’clock in the morning, and here’s a question: do you know where your AI is? Many organizations assume they have full control over the AI tools within their environments, but the reality is often more complex. Enter Shadow AI—the unsanctioned or untracked use of AI systems within a corporate environment.

Generative AI's potential has inspired employees to explore ways to leverage it for various tasks. However, not all of these initiatives are approved or monitored by IT and security teams. These shadow projects, while innovative, pose significant cybersecurity risks, including the potential for data leaks or exposure to vulnerabilities. Organizations must discover and assess all instances of AI in their environments—especially the ones flying under the radar—to secure and manage them effectively.

### First step - Discovery

To tackle this challenge, the first step is discovery. Businesses should start by mapping out the cloud environments they operate, as these are common locations for hosting powerful, compute-intensive AI models. Shadow AI deployments often involve a model, data used for training and tuning, and applications leveraging the model. Identifying these components is crucial.

Furthermore, open-source models downloaded from platforms like Hugging Face may not follow the same security protocols as full-fledged AI platforms such as IBM’s watsonx. These differences necessitate tailored approaches for securing various AI implementations. By using automated tools for discovery and visualization, companies can illuminate the dark corners where Shadow AI operates.

### Second step - Secure against risk

Once Shadow AI systems are identified, organizations must secure them against risks like data exfiltration, access mismanagement, and even adversarial attacks such as data poisoning. 

Ensuring robust access controls and enforcing the principle of least privilege can minimize these risks. 

Additionally, businesses should consider providing sanctioned alternatives to unsanctioned AI tools, as saying "no" often drives employees to seek unapproved solutions.

Ultimately, visibility and control are key. Organizations must implement security posture management for AI systems, ensuring that these tools benefit the business without introducing avoidable risks. 

By shining a light on Shadow AI, companies can turn potential threats into assets, fostering innovation while maintaining robust security practices.

## What Is a Prompt Injection Attack?

> Prompt injection occurs when an attacker inserts malicious instructions into the input to alter the AI’s behavior. 

Prompt injection attacks exploit the flexibility of AI systems, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs). 

These systems generate responses based on input prompts, but their design can make them susceptible to malicious manipulation. 

### Example

A striking example involved a chatbot at a car dealership. A user cleverly tricked the chatbot by instructing it to agree with everything the customer said and declare every statement as a legally binding agreement. Following this setup, the user proposed buying an SUV for $1, and the chatbot dutifully responded, “Yes, we have a deal, and that's a legally binding agreement.”

While this may seem absurd, it highlights a serious vulnerability—AI systems can be “socially engineered” into behaving contrary to their intended programming.

### Description

Prompt injection occurs when an attacker inserts malicious instructions into the input to alter the AI’s behavior. 

These attacks often exploit the blurred boundaries between training data and user instructions inherent in LLMs. For example, attackers might prompt the AI to perform unauthorized actions, bypassing safeguards designed to prevent harmful behavior. 

More sophisticated forms of this attack include “jailbreaking,” where users coerce the AI into operating outside its ethical and security constraints, such as generating malware or misinformation.

The implications of prompt injection attacks are profound. They can lead to data leakage, the dissemination of false or dangerous information, and even remote system hijacking. 

### Conclusion

Addressing this threat requires a multi-faceted approach: curating high-quality training data, implementing robust input validation, and integrating human oversight. As AI evolves, combating prompt injection will remain an ongoing challenge, akin to an arms race between developers and attackers.
