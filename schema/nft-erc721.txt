* ERC-721 (Non-Fungible Token Standard)
** Core Interface (ERC721)
*** Events
**** Transfer - Emitted when an NFT is transferred, minted, or burned
**** Approval - Emitted when an NFT's approved address changes
**** ApprovalForAll - Emitted when an operator is enabled/disabled for an owner
*** Functions
**** Balance
***** balanceOf - Returns the number of NFTs owned by an address
***** ownerOf - Returns the owner of a given NFT
**** Approval
***** approve - Approves another address to transfer a specific NFT
***** setApprovalForAll - Grants/revokes operator access for all NFTs of an owner
***** getApproved - Returns the approved address for a specific NFT
***** isApprovedForAll - Checks if an operator is approved for all NFTs of an owner
**** Transfe
***** safeTransferFrom (with data) - Securely transfers an NFT, checks recipient contract
***** safeTransferFrom - Transfers an NFT safely, ensuring recipient supports ERC-721
***** transferFrom - Transfers an NFT (no recipient check, risk of lost tokens)
** Metadata Extension (ERC721Metadata)
*** Functions
**** name - Returns the collection name
**** symbol - Returns the ticker symbol
**** tokenURI - Returns a unique URI pointing to NFT metadata
** Token Receiver (ERC721TokenReceiver)
*** Functions
**** onERC721Received - Ensures recipient contracts can handle ERC-721 tokens
*** Security Considerations
**** Must return `0x150b7a02` to accept NFT transfers
**** Prevent lost NFTs by always using `safeTransferFrom`
**** Avoid malicious contracts that accept NFTs but lock them
** Security Considerations
*** Safe Transfers
**** Always use `safeTransferFrom` to prevent NFTs from being locked in non-compliant contracts
**** Verify recipient contract implements `onERC721Received`
**** Risk of Re-Entrancy
*** Approval Management
**** Reset approvals on transfers to prevent unauthorized actions
**** Be cautious when using `setApprovalForAll`, as it grants full access
*** Metadata Handling
**** Store metadata on decentralized networks like IPFS or Arweave
**** Avoid centralized metadata to prevent censorship and broken links
*** Re-Entrancy Protection
**** Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
**** Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ReentrancyGuard` if needed
