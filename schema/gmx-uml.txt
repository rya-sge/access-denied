* GMX V2 Protocol Mechanics
** Overview
*** Decentralized protocol for perpetual swaps & spot trading
*** Core participants: Traders, Liquidity Providers (LPs), Keepers
*** Two-step order process: Create → Execute
*** Uses Oracles for accurate price data

** Core Participants
*** Traders
**** Perform swaps or open leveraged long/short positions
**** Pay execution & funding fees
**** Profit added to account; loss deducted from collateral
*** Liquidity Providers (LPs)
**** Provide assets (e.g. ETH, USDC) to GM Pools
**** Earn share of protocol fees
**** Risk exposure when traders are profitable
**** Deposit/withdraw liquidity via orders
*** Keepers
**** Automated executors (bots)
**** Execute orders on-chain
**** Submit oracle price feeds
**** Compensated through execution fees

** Two-Step Order Execution
*** Step 1: Create Order
**** User (Trader or LP) creates order & pays execution fee
*** Step 2: Execute Order
**** Keeper executes order on-chain
**** Enables efficient gas usage & timing flexibility

** Liquidity Provision
*** Deposit Order
**** LP specifies token & long/short backing, pays fee
**** Keeper executes deposit into GM Pool
*** Withdraw Order
**** Reverse process to remove liquidity
**** Also executed by Keeper

** Trading Process
*** Swaps
**** Exchange tokens using GM Pool liquidity & oracle prices
*** Long Positions
**** Opened against GM Pool using collateral
**** Profit if price increases
*** Short Positions
**** Opened against GM Pool using collateral
**** Profit if price decreases
*** Closing Positions
**** Also uses create + execute order pattern

** Profit & Loss Handling
*** Trader Profit
**** Paid from GM Pool (LP liquidity)
*** Trader Loss
**** Deducted from collateral; remains in pool → benefits LPs

** Fees
*** Execution Fee
**** Paid by both Traders & LPs
**** Compensates Keepers for gas costs
**** Excess refunded automatically
*** Funding Fee
**** Applies to open long/short positions
**** Balances open interest (longs vs shorts)
**** Side with higher open interest pays the other

** Keepers & Oracles
*** Keepers monitor & execute pending orders
*** Submit up-to-date market prices via Oracles
*** Ensure accurate swaps, PnL, and liquidation pricing
*** Critical for maintaining protocol integrity

** Interdependencies & Risks
*** Traders depend on LP liquidity
*** LPs depend on trader activity & fees
*** Both rely on Keepers for execution
*** Risks
**** Traders: lose collateral on failed trades
**** LPs: lose liquidity if traders are consistently profitable
